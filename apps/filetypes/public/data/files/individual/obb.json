  "name": "Android Opaque Binary Blob File",
  "summary": "An OBB file is an expansion file used by some Android apps distributed via the Google Play online store. It contains data not stored in the application's main package (.APK file), such as graphics, media files, and other large program assets, due to size constraints (typically stored in a device's shared storage folder). Google replaced OBB expansion files with the Android App Bundle (.AAB) format in August 2021.",
