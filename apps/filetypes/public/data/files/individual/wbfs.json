  "summary": "A WBFS file is a Nintendo Wii game disk image created using Wiimms WBFS Tool, Wii Backup Manager, or another Nintendo Wii-related program. It contains a Wii game that can be played on a Nintendo Wii, using USB Loader GX, or a Wii emulator, such as Dolphin. While players previously had to store and load WBFS files from specially-formatted USB drives, they can now store WBFS files on FAT32- or NTFS-formatted drives.",
