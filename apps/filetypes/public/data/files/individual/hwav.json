  "summary": "An HWAV file is an audio file used by 3hs, a homebrew client that allows users to install content from hShop directly onto their 3DS. It contains background music in the Homebrew WAV (HWAV) format, which is based on the Binary CWAV (.BCWAV) format used by the 3DS system. HWAV files support additional tags and metadata in their headers, making them more flexible for custom use in 3hs.",
