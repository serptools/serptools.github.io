  "summary": "A BWF file is an audio file saved in the Broadcast Wave Format (BWF), which is an extension of the standard WAVE audio format and designed for professional audio production and broadcasting. It stores audio data similarly to a .WAV file but includes metadata in its header, such as timestamps, description tags, and other technical details. By storing this extra information, the format helps with synchronization, editing, and cataloging, making BWF files useful in radio, television, and film production.",
