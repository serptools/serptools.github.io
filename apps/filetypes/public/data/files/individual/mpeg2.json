  "summary": "An MPEG2 file is a video file encoded using the MPEG-2 codec, which is typically used to compress over-the-air, satellite, and cable TV transmissions, as well as DVD video. It is compressed using lossy compression, which significantly reduces the size of the video and audio data it contains. MPEG-2 compression is less efficient than H.264 (.H264) compression.",
