  "summary": "A RUMBA file is a normal file, such as a document, image, or video, that has been renamed and encrypted by RUMBA ransomware. Because the file is encrypted and being held hostage, you cannot open it. Typically, the .rumba extension is added to the file's normal extension, producing a file whose name ends in an extension like .jpg.rumba.",
