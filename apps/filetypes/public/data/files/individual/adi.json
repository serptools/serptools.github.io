  "summary": "An ADI file is a disk image created by AOMEI Backupper, a backup and recovery program for Windows. It contains a complete copy of the data stored on a hard disk, which allows users to restore the disk in cases of data loss, hardware failure, or corruption. ADI files can be compressed and split into smaller parts, and also support options such as incremental and differential backups, which let users update existing backups without duplicating all data.",
