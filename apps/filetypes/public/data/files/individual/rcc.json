  "name": "Recap Compressed Structured Scan Data File",
  "summary": "An RCC file is a compressed data file created by Autodesk Recap, a program used to generate 3D models or 2D drawings by scanning images. It contains structured scan data captured from a fixed-origin static or terrestrial 3D laser scanner on a tripod. RCC files are compressed to reduce the size of the file since structured scans can become very large.",
