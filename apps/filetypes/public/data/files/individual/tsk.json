  "summary": "A TSK file is a theme file used by Pocket PC devices, which were early personal digital assistants (PDAs) that ran on Microsoft’s Windows Mobile operating system. It contains a background image, menu styling, and color scheme settings that define the look of the device’s interface, including the home screen and menus, in a format similar to the Windows Cabinet (.CAB) format. Pocket PC users installed TSK files to personalize the appearance of their device’s interface with custom colors, wallpapers, and design styles.",
