  "summary": "An APC file is an audio file used by a CRYO Interactive Entertainment video game. It contains music, sound effects, or dialogue that is played within a game. APC files cannot be played by most popular media players, so if you want to play the files outside the game in which they are used, you may need to convert them to a standard audio format.",
