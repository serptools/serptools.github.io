  "summary": "A BITSBOARD file is a Zip-compressed Bitsboard board. Typically, Bitsboard saves boards as directories, which contain images, audio files, and/or a Bitsboard.plist file. In some cases, however, a user may Zip-compress a board and rename the resulting .ZIP file's extension to .bitsboard. This allows the user to share their board with others more easily.",
