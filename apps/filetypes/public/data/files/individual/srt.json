  "summary": "An SRT file contains subtitle text and timing information in the SubRip file format, one of the most common formats for providing subtitles for videos, including those online. Many media players, including VideoLAN VLC media player and MPlayer, and online video-streaming sites, such as YouTube, support SRT subtitles. Users can also open and edit SRT files with subtitle and text editors since they store plain text.",
