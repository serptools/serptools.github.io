  "summary": "A YML file is a text document that contains data formatted using YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language), a human-readable data format used for data serialization. It is used for reading and writing data independent of a specific programming language. Because YAML syntax is language-agnostic, YML files can be incorporated into programs written in most popular programming languages, including C/C++, Ruby, Python, Java, Perl, C#, PHP, and others.",
