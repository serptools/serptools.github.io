  "summary": "A DLIS file is a log file created by sensors that monitor petroleum wells, which are holes drilled in the ground for the purpose of exchanging petroleum between a subsurface reservoir and the surface. It contains a database of well measurements such as resistivity, porosity, sonic, and magnetic resonance measurements. DLIS files are saved in the Digital Log Interchange Standard for interchanging well log data.",
