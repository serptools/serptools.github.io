  "summary": "An FDMDOWNLOAD file is a partially downloaded file created by version 5 and later of Free Download Manager, an Internet download management utility. It stores the contents of a file as it is being received by Free Download Manager and uses the .fdmdownload extension to mark the download as incomplete until it finishes, at which point the .fdmdownload extension is removed. FDMDOWNLOAD files are similar to .CRDOWNLOAD and .TORCHDOWNLOAD files, which are used by various web browsers.",
