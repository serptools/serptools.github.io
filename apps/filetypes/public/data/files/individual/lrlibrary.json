  "summary": "An LRLIBRARY file is a photo library used by Adobe Lightroom, a photo editing and management application. It stores copies of images that users import into Lightroom and data that the app references to organize and manage the imported images, which helps reduce loading times (similar to a cache). Lightroom automatically creates the LRLIBRARY file, named Lightroom Library.lrlibrary, and saves it in the user's Pictures folder when the user installs the application.",
