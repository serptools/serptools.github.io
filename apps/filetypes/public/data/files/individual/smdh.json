  "summary": "An SMDH file is a metadata file used by Nintendo 3DS video games. It contains a game's 3DS menu icons, localized titles, region-specific settings (such as a game's region-specific age rating), and other data. Outside of actual, Nintendo-published 3DS games, SMDH files are most often created for and used by homebrew games run using The Homebrew Launcher.",
