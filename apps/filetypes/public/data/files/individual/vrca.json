  "summary": "A VRCA file is an avatar used in VRChat, a free-to-play virtual reality (VR) social platform. It is a Unity AssetBundle that contains the 3D model, textures, shaders, and other data used to show a player's in-game character. Most VRChat players will never encounter a VRCA file, unless they download a VRCA file from a VRChat-related website or access the public avatars they own using VRChat's API.",
