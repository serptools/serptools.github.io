  "summary": "A NOMEDIA file is an empty text file stored on an Android mobile device or external storage card. The file marks the folder it resides within, as well as that folder's sub-folders, as having no multimedia data. This tells multimedia players, gallery apps, and other apps looking for media files to skip the folder when scanning for media files. NOMEDIA files have no filename prefix; they are named just .nomedia.",
