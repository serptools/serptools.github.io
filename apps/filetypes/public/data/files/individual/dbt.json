  "summary": "A DBT file contains the text for memo fields in database tables (.DBF files) created by various database management applications, such as dBASE and Microsoft Visual FoxPro. Memo fields included in a database point to the locations of DBT files, which store the HTML-formatted text. Pointing to external DBT files reduces the DBF file size and allows memos to store more text.",
