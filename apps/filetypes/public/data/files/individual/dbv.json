  "summary": "A DBV file contains information that defines database fields of variable length, including the size of text and binary (BLOB data type) fields, in .DBF Database files. Users typically do not open DBV files. Instead, when a user opens a DBF file that references the DBV file, the software automatically loads the information in the DBV file to format the database fields.",
