  "summary": "An HEVC file contains a video stored in the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) format. This format, also known as H.265, improves over the H.264 standard by allowing videos to be stored with a lower file size but with the same video quality. HEVC helps users store more videos on their devices and also substantially reduces the file size of high-resolution videos such as 4K and 8K videos.",
