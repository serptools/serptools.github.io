  "summary": "An AI file is a vector graphic created by Adobe Illustrator or exported by another graphics program, such as Adobe Photoshop. Unlike raster images, which are made up of pixels, AI files store graphics as paths connected by anchor points using the Adobe Illustrator Artwork (AI) format. This vector-based structure allows users to scale artwork up or down without losing image quality, making AI files ideal for logos, illustrations, icons, and print-ready designs.",
