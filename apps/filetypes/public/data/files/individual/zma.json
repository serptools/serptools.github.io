  "summary": "A ZMA file contains speaker impedance data created by SPL Tracer, a tool that converts speaker measurement graphs into digital data. It stores numeric data, such as impedance values and phase response, which are used to evaluate and simulate the performance of a speaker driver. ZMA files are similar to .FRD files, which store frequency response data.",
