For example, a patient who visits a CVS to receive a vaccination can request a SMART Health Card verifying that vaccination. The patient can then share the SMART Health Card with others who need to see their vaccination record, as a paper copy or QR code.","When a patient requests a SMART Health Card from their provider or clinic, the card may arrive in the form of a SMART-HEALTH-CARD file. This file can be imported into health information apps such as OneRecord or Health Wallet. After importing the file, the patient can access the information it contains in the app. The file consists of plain text that begins with the string \"verifiableCredential\": .","Patients can also export their information out of some health information apps as SMART-HEALTH-CARD files, to be used in other apps.","NOTE: The SMART Health Card format was developed by the SMART Health IT project, Boston Children's Hospital, and VCI (Verifiable Clinical Information). Only organizations approved by VCI can issue SMART Health Cards."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/smart-health-card_12794.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .smart-health-card file in Apple TextEdit","caption":"SMART-HEALTH-CARD file open in Apple TextEdit"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"smart-health-card.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
