The program provides a variety of tools for designing the layout of your document and applying various effects and filters to the different document elements. When you save a comic in Comic Life 2 or earlier, the program creates the COMIC file and stores the project information in the file. When you are finished with your work you can export the document to a variety of formats, such as .PDF , .JPG , .GIF , and .PNG .","NOTE: COMIC files were replaced by .CL2DOC files in Comic Life 2 and .COMICDOC files in Comic Life 3. If you are using version 2 or earlier, it is important to note that the COMIC format is not supported by version 3 or later of Comic Life. If you have a COMIC file and want to open it in Comic Life version 3 or later you can save it as a .COMICDOC file. You must first download version 1 or 2 of Comic Life, then open the COMIC file. Next, save the comic strip as a COMICDOC file (or a CL2DOC file if you have Comic Life 2). You can then open the COMICDOC or CL2DOC file in version 3 of Comic Life."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/comic_10403.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .comic file in Comic Life 2","caption":"COMIC file open in Comic Life 2"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"comic.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
