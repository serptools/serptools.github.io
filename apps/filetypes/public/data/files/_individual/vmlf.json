When the correct codec is unavailable to decompress the PMB or WMM video project files, they are converted into a folder that contains a VMLF and .VMLT file. If this occurs, open the VMLF file with the GSpot utility, which examines the file and proposes a solution for playing the file.","NOTE: VMLF files contain the same video data as VMLT files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vmlf.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
