When a developer saves their game development project, GB Studio creates a project-specific directory. This directory contains all the project's assets, a GBSPROJ file, and a GBSPROJ.BAK file (a backup of the GBSPROJ file).","GBSPROJ files are renamed .JSON files that contain project metadata and describe a project's structure and included assets. To re-open a GB Studio project, developers select and open that project's GBSTUDIO file.","NOTE: If a GBSTUDIO file is not stored alongside its associated assets, the file and associated project will not open correctly."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/gbsproj_13616.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .gbsproj file in GB Studio","caption":"GBSPROJ file open in GB Studio"},{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/gbsproj_13616-2.png","alt":"GBSPROJ file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"GBSPROJ file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"gbsproj.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
