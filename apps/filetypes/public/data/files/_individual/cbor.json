The format was further defined and formalized in the Internet Engineering Task Force's Request for Comments 8949 , published in December 2020.","Just like JSON files, CBOR files are most often used to exchange information among computers, servers, and other devices (especially Internet of Things devices). Because CBOR files are saved in a more-concise, binary format, devices can process CBOR files more quickly than they can process JSON files. The tradeoff, however, is that users cannot easily open CBOR files and examine the data they contain."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"cbor.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
