In the game, players conduct a series of missions that culminate in them playing as Luke Skywalker, piloting his X-Wing in an attempt to destroy the Death Star.","X-Wing's in-game missions are saved as XWI files, stored in the game's MISSION directory. The game loads a corresponding XWI and BRF file when a player begins the related mission.","While not officially supported, players can create custom XWI (and corresponding BRF) files using X-Wing Mission Builder, a custom mission creation tool. X-Wing Mission Builder also contains template custom mission files, which players can open, examine, modify, and play."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"xwi.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
