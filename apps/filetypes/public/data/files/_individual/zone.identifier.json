They have the same filename as the original file, followed by a colon and the text \"Zone.Identifier.\" For example, the file \" download.exe:Zone.Identifier \" may be saved along with a downloaded file named \" download.exe .\"","Windows uses zone identifier files to manage security settings for downloaded files. Since the files are referenced by the operating system, they are not meant to be opened manually. When the original file is deleted, the corresponding zone identifier file is automatically removed by the operating system. Zone identifier files are hidden by default, but may be visible if the \"Show Hidden Files\" option is turned on."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"zone.identifier.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
