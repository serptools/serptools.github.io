This metadata then appears in music libraries and media players, making the tagged MP3 files easier to sort and identify.","If a Titel user knows they're going to add similar metadata to a group of MP3 files, they can save that metadata (or a subset of it) as a Titel template. These TEMPL files are plain text files, which store saved tags in the order in which they appear in Titel."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/templ_13597.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .templ file in Titel","caption":"TEMPL file open in Titel"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"templ.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
