Professional artists in fields such as architecture or prototyping often use the software to create photorealistic images. The apps are very similar, but Indigo RT offers fewer capabilities and is less expensive. Indigo Renderer is also available as a standalone application or as a plugin for other 3D CAD programs.","Rendering scenes in Indigo Renderer or Indigo RT can take a long time and a lot of computing resources. Due to the heavy load of some renders, the software allows you to pause a render and resume at a more suitable time.","After starting a render, you can save the progress in an IGI file. To create an IGI file with Indigo Renderer or Indigo RT, select Render â†’ Save IGI for resuming .","After selecting this option, Indigo Renderer saves the HDR buffer as an image, and when you load it, the rendering state is restored."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"igi.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
