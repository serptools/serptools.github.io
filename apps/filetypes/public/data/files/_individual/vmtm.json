In addition, VMware introduced the Teams feature when it released Workstation 5 to allow you to manage multiple VMs in different environments better.","When creating a team of VMs, the software creates a VMTM file to store configuration information for the team. You can modify and save a configuration as a VMTM file and load team configurations in a VMTM file through the VMware user interface.","NOTE: VMware replaced the Teams feature in Workstation 8 and no longer supports VMTM files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vmtm.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
