The standard format for saving scores in MuseScore is the MSCZ format.","When you modify and save a score saved as an MSCZ file, MuseScore creates an MSCZ_SAVING file as it writes the data to the new file. Once complete, MuseScore replaces the old MSCZ file with the MSCZ_SAVING file by removing the _saving extension. This method of saving protects against the loss of the old and new score in the event of a crash while saving (only the new score written to the MSCZ_SAVING file is lost)."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mscz_saving.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
