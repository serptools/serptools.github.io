When creating in-game objects, developers use VTEX_C files to apply textures to those objects. Any common image file, such as a .PNG , .TGA , or .PSD files, can be used to create a VTEX_C texture.","The textures VTEX_C files contain are referenced by VMAT files, which are Source 2 materials files. VMAT files are used to apply the textures that VTEX_C files contain to an in-game object, along with shading and material properties that further define how the object appears. VMAT files are compiled into .VMAT_C files when a developer compiles their Source 2 game.","While most gamers will never encounter a VTEX_C file, those who want to mod Valve Source 2 games or create their own Source 2-powered games may interact with VTEX_C files. For example, those who want to mod Half-Life: Alyx or Dota 2 using Valve's official modding toolkits may encounter VTEX_C files after creating a material."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vtex_c.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
