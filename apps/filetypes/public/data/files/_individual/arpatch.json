{"slug":"arpatch","extension":"arpatch","name":"Spark AR Patch Asset","category":"spark-ar-patch-asset","summary":"","developer_org":"facebook","developer_name":"Facebook","more_information":{"description":["Spark AR Studio allows Facebook users to create AR effects that they can apply to Facebook and Instagram videos. For example, a Spark AR Studio user could create a \"disco inferno\" effect that adds a 3D disco ball and flames to their Facebook videos.","If a user wants to add logic, interactivity, or animations to their Spark AR Studio effect, they can do so using AR Studio's Patch Editor. The Patch Editor is a block-based code editor that allows users to edit their effects. To edit an effect, users add blocks, or patches, to the Patch Editor. They then link the patches together to manipulate their effect.","Sometimes, users may want to quickly apply a group of patches to another Spark AR Studio effect or share the group with another Spark AR Studio user. To do so, they must first combine the patches into a patch group, and then convert the patch group to a patch asset. This patch asset, or ARPATCH file, can be imported into other instances of Spark AR Studio."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"arpatch.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
