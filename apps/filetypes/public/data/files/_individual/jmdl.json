JARC archives contain in-game model, texture, and animation files. Together, these files are used to show and animate game characters, locations, and items.","JMDL files are in-game model files, which contain a 3D model that represents an in-game character, location, or item. For example, the file used to show Wii Fit U's Wuhu Island is a JMDL file. JMDL files do not include textures or animations, as those are stored in .JTEX and .JMOT files, respectively."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"jmdl.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
