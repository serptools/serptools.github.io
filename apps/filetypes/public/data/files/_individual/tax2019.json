  "summary": "A TAX2019 file contains a United States tax return created with the 2019 version of Intuit TurboTax. It stores tax-related data, which may include personal information entered by a user, a federal IRS tax form, and one or more state forms for the 2019 tax year. Since TAX2019 files store sensitive data they may be encrypted and saved with password protection by the user preparing the return.",
