For instance, users can create programs by dragging and connecting code blocks, enabling beginners to design robotic actions without requiring prior knowledge of programming languages.","However, for more advanced users, VEXcode also supports text-based coding in Python and C++ . For example, they can open the Code Viewer in VEXcode V5, choose the Python option, and then select Convert to Text Project . They can select File â†’ Save As to save it as a V5PYTHON file. If a VEXcode V5 user chooses the C++ option, they can save their projects as .V5CPP files."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/v5python_13774.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .v5python file in VEX Robotics VEXcode V5","caption":"V5PYTHON file open in VEX Robotics VEXcode V5"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"v5python.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
