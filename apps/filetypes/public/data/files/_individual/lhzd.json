The files can store information for a variety of project types, such as a kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, office, living room, office, or house exterior. You can begin from scratch or from one of the Live Home 3D templates. You can also save a project as a template if you want to duplicate its properties for other similar projects. Templates are also saved with the \".lhzd\" extension.","Live Home 3D allows you to export an LHZD file to other file formats, such as .PDF , .JPG , .BMP , .PNG , .TIFF , .SKP , .DAE , ZAE, .3DS , .FBX , .WRL , .X3D , RIB, .OBJ , .SCN , SCNZ, and USDZ.
