The games use these files to play in-game sound effects. Games that include SNR files also commonly include .SNS files (which may contain sound effects or music). Like SNS files, SNR files are typically encoded using EA's XAS or Layer3 audio codecs.","While SNR files are not meant to be opened by players, game modders have created tools that allow them to play the sounds that SNR files contain. Modders have also created tools that allow them to convert .WAV files to the SNR format, such as wav_to_snr and EALayer3 ."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/snr_13602.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .snr file in vgmstream-web","caption":"SNR file open in vgmstream-web"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"snr.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
