Whereas other JavaScript-based application frameworks, such as React and Vue, allow developers to create applications that are compiled largely in-browser, Svelte allows developers to create applications that are compiled prior to being rendered in a browser. This allows Svelte web applications to load and run more quickly than React and Vue applications.","Source code files written using Svelte syntax are saved in SVELTE files. A SVELTE file may contain an application's top-level code or an application component."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"svelte.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
