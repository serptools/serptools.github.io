{"slug":"gero","extension":"gero","name":"GERO Ransomware Encrypted File","category":"gero-ransomware-encrypted-file","summary":"","developer_org":"n-a","developer_name":"N/A","more_information":{"description":["STOP ransomware, also known as STOP Djvu ransomware, is a common family of ransomware that cybercriminals use to extort ransoms from PC users. The GERO variant of STOP ransomware first appeared in August 2019. It encrypts a user's files and then produces a plain text ransom note named _readme.txt in every folder that contains an infected file. The note contains instructions users are meant to follow to decrypt their files.","GERO and subsequent versions of STOP ransomware differ significantly from previous versions. Prior versions of STOP ransomware encrypted files using an offline key, which could be found on a user's system and used to decrypt their files. GERO encrypts files using an online key, which is stored on the cybercriminals' server, not on the user's system. Thus, previously effective STOP decryption tools typically do not work on GERO and later versions of STOP ransomware.","GERO ransomware is most commonly distributed within programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and installed an unverified program, that may be how your computer became infected by GERO ransomware.","NOTE: To learn more about STOP ransomware and its variants, refer to the .STOP entry."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"gero.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
