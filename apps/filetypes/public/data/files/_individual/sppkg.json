Because Valve encourages players to modify their games, Portal 2 has a healthy and enthusiastic modding community.","To make modifying Portal 2 easier, P2R3 (also known as PortalRunner) created Spplicer and Spplice. Spplicer allows modders to package Portal 2 mods they've created (in the portal2_dlc format) as SPPKG files, which are renamed .ZIP archives. Modders can then upload their SPPKG files to an online mod repository, which other players can access using Spplice."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"sppkg.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
