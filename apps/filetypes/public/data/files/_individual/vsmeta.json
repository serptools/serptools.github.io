{"slug":"vsmeta","extension":"vsmeta","name":"Video Station Metadata File","category":"video-station-metadata-file","summary":"","developer_org":"synology","developer_name":"Synology","more_information":{"description":["Synology Video Station is a video organization and playing application that allows users to watch videos stored on devices other than their current computer. For example, a user might use Video Station to connect their laptop to the Movies directory on their home computer, so they can play movies stored on their home computer while they travel.","Typically, Video Station automatically retrieves metadata for a user's videos from the Internet. It then stores all that metadata in one local database file. However, if a user manually edits the metadata Video Station has assigned to a video, Video Station will create a VSMETA file that contains the manually-edited metadata. Video Station will then use the VSMETA file to show the edited metadata. VSMETA files also store a copy of their associated video's Video Station thumbnail image.","NOTE: Video Station saves VSMETA files in the same folder as the file's associated video. So, if you have edited the metadata of videos stored in different locations, you will encounter a VSMETA file in each location."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vsmeta.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
