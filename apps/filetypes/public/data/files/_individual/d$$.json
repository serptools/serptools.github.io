Interpreters, like AGiliTy, emulate older machines from the 1980s and 1990s in order to play AGT games.","AGT games can be packaged with a wide variety of files that contain game data, including .TTL , .INS , and .VOC . Because of the large number of files that accompany the AGT game, the files can be converted into a single .AGX file with the AGT2AGX utility that comes with AGiliTy. This conversion reduces game size over 100K, decreases load time, and reduces clutter."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"[name of the game].d$$","description":"[name of the game].d$$ - The D$$ file bears the same name of the game."}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"d$$.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
