This Device Account Number is stored in your device's Secure Element, where it is isolated from your device's operating system and your iCloud backups. The Device Account Number is used only when you make a payment using Apple Pay.","Just like other hardware, the Secure Element sometimes receives firmware updates, allowing it to function correctly when used with an updated version of iOS. These firmware updates are stored in SEFW files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"sefw.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
