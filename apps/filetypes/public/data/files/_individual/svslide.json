Pathologists can use the VisionTek system to view live specimens or specimens scanned and saved as virtual slide images. Virtual slide images are saved and stored as SVSLIDE files.","SVSLIDE files contain multiple images saved at different sizes and resolutions , which the VisionTek system and other slide-viewing applications combine into one composite image. This allows pathologists to zoom in and out on a slide image, to view specimen sections in more or less detail.","The images that SVSLIDE files contain are organized in a SQLite 3 database, which contains multiple tables. Each table contains metadata and/or an image that is used to create the composite image shown within slide-viewing software."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"svslide.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
