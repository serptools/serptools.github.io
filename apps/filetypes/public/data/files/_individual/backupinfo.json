  "summary": "A BACKUPINFO file is a text file created by AromaBackup, a Minecraft mod that allows players to back up their Minecraft worlds. It contains metadata describing a backed-up world, including the world's name, the date the world was backed up, and whether the backup is a full or incremental backup. BACKUPINFO files' names correspond to the name of the backup they describe. For example, a world backed up within the file 2019-09-23--07-01.zip would be accompanied by a BACKUPINFO file named 2019-09-23--07-01.backupinfo.",
