The Metal Shading Language determines GPU performance and is saved in METAL files.","Developers using Xcode to create apps for platforms such as iOS and macOS may build METAL files into default libraries to improve app graphic performance. In this case, Xcode automatically generates METALLIB files from METAL files.","Developers may also use the Xcode metal command-line utility to compile multiple METAL files into a single AIR file. Then, they may use the metallib tool to build AIR files into METALLIB libraries for use by the app."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/metal_13667.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .metal file in Apple Xcode 15.2","caption":"METAL file open in Apple Xcode 15.2"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"metal.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
