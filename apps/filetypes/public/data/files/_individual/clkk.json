Optionally, Clicker users (or more likely, teachers and parents) can customize the keyboard that appears in the app, to change where and how certain keys appear. For example, a user can customize a keyboard to group vowels together and show them in the same color, to help a child learn about vowels.","Clicker keyboards are saved as CLKK files. The app includes several default CLKK files, which group letters together in different ways using different key colors. Users can open and edit any of these CLKK files with Clicker, to customize them further. (Before doing so, it's recommended you create a copy of the CLKK file you plan to edit.)"]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"clkk.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
