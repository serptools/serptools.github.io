TAR files typically contain multiple files packaged together for easier storage and sharing, including storing a library of digital photographs or distributing software packages.","However, TAR files are not compressed . To reduce the size of TAR archives, users can choose from various compression algorithms, such as GNU Zip (gzip) or Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain Algorithm (LZMA), that result in .TAR.GZ and .TAR.LZMA files. Additionally, compressing a TAR archive with the Zip algorithm may result in a TAR.ZIP file or ZIP file."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/tar_zip_13728.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .tar.zip file in Microsoft File Explorer","caption":"TAR.ZIP file open in Microsoft File Explorer"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"tar.zip.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
