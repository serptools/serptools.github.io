Users organizing complex or interconnected information, such as researchers, writers, and students, often use Canvas to brainstorm, plan, or explore ideas visually.","When users select the \"Create new canvas\" feature in Obsidian, the app automatically creates a CANVAS file in the user's vault, which is a folder storing a user's notes, calendars, and imported media files. Obsidian is available on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android, and CANVAS files can be synced across platforms using Obsidian's sync service or standard file syncing tools.","NOTE: The JSON Canvas format is an open format designed to be stored locally and accessible offline to give users full control over their information. It is the native format for storing visual workspace information in Obsidian, but other programs can import and export the format, such as Kinopio, Flowchart Fun, hi-canvas, and OrgPad."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/canvas_13819.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .canvas file in Obsidian 1.8","caption":"CANVAS file open in Obsidian 1.8"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"canvas.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
