DVMRs primarily used it in the 1990s and early 2000s. However, the format became obscure as newer technologies and file formats emerged, offering improved compatibility, higher-quality video, and more efficient storage. By the late 2000s, the 60D format had largely been replaced, leading to the discontinuation of tools that supported the format, such as WaveReader and SplitWave."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"60d.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
