This ransomware is a variant of the popular .STOP family of ransomware.","Just like other STOP variants, EFJI ransomware encrypts a user's files (to prevent the user from opening them) and renames the files it encrypts. It then produces a plain text ransom note named _readme.txt in every folder that contains an infected file. This ransom note contains instructions users can supposedly follow to restore their files.","EFJI ransomware is most commonly distributed within programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and installed an unverified program, that may be how your computer became infected by EFJI ransomware."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"efji.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
