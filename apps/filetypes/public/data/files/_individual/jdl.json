After editing a JDL level, you can upload it to the game's servers to share it with other gamers.","When you download a level within the Jammer Dash interface, the game downloads the appropriate JDL file from its server. When stored on the server, the JSON data in the JDL file is encrypted for security purposes. However, the game decrypts the JSON data when downloading the level.","Then, Jammer Dash places the JDL file in its installation directory with other game resource files that store background music, graphics, etc. Finally, Jammer Dash reads the files and displays the information in the game. Additionally, when you upload a level to the game's server, the game encrypts the JSON data in the JDL file and then saves it to its server for other players to access when downloading new levels for the game."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"jdl.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
