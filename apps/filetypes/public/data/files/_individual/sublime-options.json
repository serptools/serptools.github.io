{"slug":"sublime-options","extension":"sublime-options","name":"Sublime Text Options File","category":"sublime-text-options-file","summary":"","developer_org":"jon-skinner","developer_name":"Jon Skinner","more_information":{"description":["The SUBLIME-OPTIONS file is used to describe the editing behavior of different file types, such as .HTML or .CSS files, you open in Sublime Text. Some of the preferences they can change are the color scheme within a text area, appearance of rulers, whether spellcheck is enabled, and the number of spaces a tab equals.","You can manually change file type editing preferences using the SUBLIME-OPTIONS file. There is a User File Type.sublime-options file and a Default File Type.sublime-options file, which are both located in the Packages/​Default directory. Be sure to edit the User File Type.sublime-options instead of the Default File Type.sublime-options . This prevents your customizations from being overwritten when a new version of Sublime Text is installed.","As mentioned before, you can edit preferences for certain file types using the SUBLIME-OPTIONS file. When you open a file, say a .PY file, Sublime Text references the SUBLIME-OPTIONS file (if you have created one) associated with this type and loads the preferences. The SUBLIME-OPTIONS file for the PY file type will be located in the Packages/​Python directory.","NOTE: The SUBLIME-OPTIONS file is used by the first version of Sublime Text but was replaced by the .SUBLIME-SETTINGS file in version 2."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"sublime-options.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
