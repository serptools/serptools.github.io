While the B5I file contains the actual data copied from the CD or DVD, such as music, software, or other content, the B5T file helps software interpret how that data is organized. Together, these files allow users to make accurate copies of their original discs."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"b5i.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
