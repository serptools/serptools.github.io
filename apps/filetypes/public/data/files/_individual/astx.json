It includes CodeBehind, a server-side library that allows web developers to host ASPX webpages on .NET Core servers.","Among other features, CodeBehind allows developers to create and use ASTX files. These files are templates that contain design-oriented webpage elements. Using these templates, developers can quickly integrate design elements into one or more CodeBehind ASPX files. Because CodeBehind supports both ASPX and Razor syntax, ASTX files may include both ASPX- and Razor-formatted elements."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"astx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
