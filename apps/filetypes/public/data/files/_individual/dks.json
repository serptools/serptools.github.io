It allows users to search for files with the same name, creation time, size, or type, as well as files with similar names. Users can then manually or automatically delete any duplicate files DupKiller finds.","Because DupKiller has many settings spread across a variety of screens, it allows users to save their search and file deletion settings in a DKS file. Then, if a user wants to reuse the settings they used to perform a previous search, they can do so by loading their DKS file."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/dks_12216.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .dks file in DupKiller","caption":"DKS file open in DupKiller"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"dks.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
