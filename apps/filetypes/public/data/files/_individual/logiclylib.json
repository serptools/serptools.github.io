In addition to allowing users to create simple circuits (saved as .LOGICLY files), Logicly allows users to create custom integrated circuits. Users can then re-use these custom integrated circuits in other designs.","If a user wants to export the integrated circuits they've created, to re-use them later, they can select File â†’ Export Integrated Circuit Library... from Logicly's menu bar. This saves all the custom integrated circuits included in the user's current project as a LOGICLYLIB file. Each integrated circuit includes a circuit layout, name, and identifying symbol, all of which are stored in the LOGICLYLIB file."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/logiclylib_13167.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .logiclylib file in Bowler Hat Logicly","caption":"LOGICLYLIB file open in Bowler Hat Logicly"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"logiclylib.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
