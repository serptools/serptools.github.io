Players unlock new theme parks by successfully managing their current park.","These parks' initial layouts are saved as PRK files. Thrillville games use these files to load a park's default rides and attractions when the player unlocks that park. Players can then modify the park, by building new rides and attractions."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"prk.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
