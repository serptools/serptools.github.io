The text files that Nintendo's translation team edits within Message Studio are MSTXT files.","Initially, MSTXT files contain only the Japanese dialog used in the Japanese version of a Nintendo game. As Nintendo's translation team localizes the game for additional regions, they add translated dialog written in the game's other languages. When the translation team has finished adding translations for a game, they save each language's in-game dialog within its own, individual MSBT file. These MSBT files are then included in each region's version of the game."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mstxt.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
