Zepetto released Point Blank in South Korea in 2008 and in North America (as Piercing Blow) in 2010.","Point Blank stores many of its game assets in a set of I3PACK archives. Each I3PACK file typically contains a collection of related game assets. For example, an I3PACK file may contain all the data needed to load a particular in-game weapon, or it may contain a collection of in-game audio files.","While players are not meant to open I3PACK files or modify their contents, some Point Blank enthusiasts have created tools that allow them to extract I3PACK files' contents."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"i3pack.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
