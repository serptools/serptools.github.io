Those using Dolphin to play Wii games can use a .RAW file as a virtual SD card. Just as the Nintendo Wii loads data from and saves data to a physical SD card, Dolphin loads data from and saves data to RAW files.","While Dolphin is writing data to a player's RAW file, it appends the .xxx extension to that file. This signals that a player should not close Dolphin or move or modify their RAW file, since it is currently being written to. After Dolphin finishes writing data to a .raw.xxx file, it removes the .xxx extension from that file's name."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"raw.xxx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
