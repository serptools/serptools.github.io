For example, if you create private key A and public key B as complementary keys, only public key B can decrypt files encrypted with private key A. This helps verify the identity of the sender of the file and limits distribution to the entities that have the appropriate keys.","NOTE: Encrypted files created by Advanced Encryption Package use the .AEP file extension."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"aepkey.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
