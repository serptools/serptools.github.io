{"slug":"vmat","extension":"vmat","name":"Valve Source 2 Material File","category":"valve-source-2-material-file","summary":"","developer_org":"valve","developer_name":"Valve","more_information":{"description":["Source 2 is a proprietary game engine Valve has used to create video games such as Dota 2 Reborn, Half-Life: Alyx, and Artifact. When creating in-game objects, developers use VTEX_C and VMAT files to apply materials to those objects. VTEX_C files contain the texture(s) that appear on an object, and VMAT files contain references to VTEX_C files as well as shading and material properties that control how textures appear when applied to a specific object.","While most gamers will never encounter a VMAT file, those who want to mod Valve Source 2 games or create their own Source 2-powered games may interact with VMAT files. For example, those who want to mod Half-Life: Alyx or Dota 2 using Valve's official modding toolkits may encounter or create VMAT files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vmat.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
