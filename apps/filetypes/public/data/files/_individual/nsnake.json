The game includes a number of default NSNAKE files that are used as game levels. Users can also create their own custom game levels and save the levels as NSNAKE files, following the instructions laid out on nSnake's GitHub wiki.","Each NSNAKE file typically includes a few lines of metadata, describing the level's name, author, created on date, and other relevant information. The game level the file describes begins at the file's start line and ends at the file's end line. The # s and blank spaces that appear between those lines comprise the level a player must navigate. The @ symbol represents a player's starting position within the level."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/nsnake_12035.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .nsnake file in GitHub Atom","caption":"NSNAKE file open in GitHub Atom"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"nsnake.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
