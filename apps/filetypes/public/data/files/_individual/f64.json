  "summary": "An F64 file is an audio file that stores raw sound data as 64-bit floating point values where a 64-bit number represents each sample of the sound wave. It is typically large in size, containing uncompressed audio information, allowing for a highly accurate representation of soft and loud sounds. Most casual users will not encounter F64 files since they are typically used in professional audio editing, mixing, and mastering tasks where maximum quality is vital.",
