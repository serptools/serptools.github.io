Individuals, businesses, and organizations can use the app across multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and web browsers.","While accounts are encrypted, users can export their accounts in the 1Password Unencrypted Export (1PUX) format when they want to transfer accounts to a different app (select File â†’ Export to do so). Users can also export account information as .CSV files, but they support a limited set of fields and will only include login and password items.","NOTE: Since 1PUX files are unencrypted, AgileBits advises users not to email them or store them online since anyone with access to them will be able to read their passwords. Users should also delete 1PUX files after transferring accounts."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"1pux.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
