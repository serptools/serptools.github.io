{"slug":"serato-stems","extension":"serato-stems","name":"Serato Studio Stems File","category":"serato-studio-stems-file","summary":"","developer_org":"serato","developer_name":"Serato","more_information":{"description":["Music producers use Serato Studio to mix samples and other audio tracks together into finished songs. Studio includes a feature called Stems, which allows producers to quickly isolate elements of an imported audio track. For example, a producer could use Stems to isolate an audio track's vocals and bass, allowing them to create a new sample using just those elements.","When a producer uses the Stems feature on an audio track, Serato Studio creates a SERATO-STEMS file associated with that track. This file has the same filename as the audio track with which it is used, except that it uses the .serato-stems extension. The SERATO-STEMS file contains data that Serato Studio uses to isolate and selectively mute each of the audio track's components.","If you use Serato Studio's Stems feature extensively, you may want to periodically delete your SERATO-STEMS files, to free up space on your computer. To find the SERATO-STEMS file associated with an imported audio file:","The directory containing your audio file and its corresponding SERATO-STEMS file will appear. You can then right-click and delete the SERATO-STEMS file."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"serato-stems.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
