It is commonly referred to as ransomware, where the purpose of the virus is to take your files hostage and force you to pay the perpetrator (typically approximately $100 USD of bitcoin) to unlock your files. The virus is a trojan horse that is typically introduced through a personal .DOC file attached to an email. Once the virus affects your computer it begins scrambling your files, renaming them, and encrypting them. The virus then generates a .TXT ransom note named HOW_TO_DECRYPT_YOUR_FILES.txt , which informs you of the takeover and what you are meant to do to recover your files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"aurora.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
