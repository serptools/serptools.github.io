{"slug":"immodules","extension":"immodules","name":"GTK+ Module File","category":"gtk+-module-file","summary":"","developer_org":"gnome-project","developer_name":"GNOME Project","more_information":{"description":["GTK+ reads the IMMODULES file at runtime to determine which input method modules are available and how to initialize them. Each entry in the file typically includes the module’s path, supported locales, and other metadata required to load and use the module correctly. Without the IMMODULES file, certain language input features will not function correctly in GTK+-built applications.","GTK+ tools (like gtk-query-immodules ) generate IMMODULES files and typically store them in system or application directories. While most end-users won’t encounter IMMODULES files, developers or system administrators who build or package GTK+ applications for multilingual environments may need to work with these files to ensure the correct input methods are available."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"immodules.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
