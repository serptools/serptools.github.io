Jenkins Pipeline is a suite of Jenkins plug-ins that allows developers to create continuous delivery pipelines (called Jenkins Pipelines) into Jenkins. This allows developers to quickly build, test, and deliver updates to software deployed through Jenkins.","When creating a Jenkins Pipeline, developers must create a text file that defines the Pipeline's stage's (e.g., Build, Test, and Deploy) and associated settings. This Pipeline definition is called a JENKINSFILE, and its filename is always .jenkinsfile .","Developers can use Jenkins, the program's Blue Ocean plug-in, or any source code editor to create and edit their JENKINSFILE. Most often, developers use Blue Ocean to create a JENKINSFILE, as part of setting up a new Jenkins Pipeline project."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":".jenkinsfile","description":".jenkinsfile - The name developers must assign to their Jenkins Pipeline's JENKINSFILE."}],"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/jenkinsfile_13552.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .jenkinsfile file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"JENKINSFILE file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"jenkinsfile.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
