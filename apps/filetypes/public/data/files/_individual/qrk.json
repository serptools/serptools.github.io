Additionally, other game development companies, such as Valve, have created and used variants of the Quake engine to develop their own 3D games.","QuArK is a modding tool that allows modders to edit Quake (and related) engine game maps and modify some other game assets (such as sounds, models, and textures). Before a modder can use QuArK to modify a game's maps, they must use QuArK Explorer to create a series of QRK files. These files tell QuArK where to find and load game assets from, for display in the program's map editor. When a modder makes a change to a game asset, QuArK uses the related QRK file to apply that change to the game asset.","NOTE: QRK files may be saved in a binary or plain text format."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"qrk.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
