However, Ultra Tracker fell into obscurity, and the UNI format never achieved the same usage as more established formats, such as .MOD , .S3M , and .XM .","Despite Ultra Tracker's obscurity, MikMod, a popular tracker during the 90s, added support for UNI files, allowing users to play UNI files alongside other tracker modules. This compatibility ensured users could still play Ultra Tracker compositions even after the software became less common."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"uni.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
