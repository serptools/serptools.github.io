The maps administrators create in DWNM are saved as DWFN files.","After opening a DWFN file, a network administrator can use that map to assess a network's signal strength (and thus the optimal location for routers and other access points), detect any interference with the network, and configure any of the devices included in the network. They can also audit the network's security and analyze network traffic."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"dwfnm.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
