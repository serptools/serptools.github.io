In Luminar 2018, when photographers saved the edits they had made to a photo, Luminar created a Luminar project file (LMNR file). This file contained the edited photo, as well as a record of the layers, adjustments, and other edits the photographer had applied to the photo.","LMNR files could be used to export Luminar-edited photos as .JPG , .TIFF , .PNG , and .PSD files. Current versions of Luminar, however, no longer support LMNR files. Instead, those versions store edited photos and a record of the edits made to those photos in Luminar catalogs, which are comprised of TIFF, .STATE , and .LUMINAR files (among others)."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"lmnr.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
