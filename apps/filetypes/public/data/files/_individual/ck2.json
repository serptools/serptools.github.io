As the game progresses, players attempt to earn prestige and continue their dynasty for as long as possible.","Crusader Kings II saves players' game progress in CK2 files. When a player manually saves their game, they can choose whether to create a compressed or uncompressed CK2 file. (Each compressed CK2 file contains both a plain text CK2 file and an accompanying meta metadata file.) Autosaves and quick saves are never compressed.","Each plain text CK2 file is comprised of several sections of data that specify the saved game's player information, events, titles, characters, relations, and many other settings. You can learn more about a CK2 file's layout and contents here ."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/ck2_13503.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .ck2 file in Apple TextEdit","caption":"CK2 file open in Apple TextEdit"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ck2.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
