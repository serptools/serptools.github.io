Typically, any changes made to a database are written directly to the main database file.","However, in WAL mode, the SQLite database engine automatically generates a .DB-WAL file to store data writes, allowing the main database to remain unaltered during the write process. The engine also generates a DB-SHM file to store data for tracking reader-writer states, checkpoint statuses, and transaction control, allowing multiple connections to the main database to synchronize. For example, if you have a primary database file named mydb.db , the SQLite engine may automatically generate mydb.db-shm and mydb.db-wal files while the database is in use.","By generating DB-WAL and DB-SHM files in WAL mode, the SQLite engine keeps the database accessible for reading by other processes while writes are pending, significantly improving performance in applications with high read-write demands. Additionally, DB-SHM and DB-WAL files may appear in an application's data storage directories, particularly in apps that utilize SQLite databases for handling large amounts of data or complex data operations across different processes.","NOTE: SQLite introduced WAL mode in 3.7.0 in July 2010."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"db-shm.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
