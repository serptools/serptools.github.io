It is developed by Lonestar Softworx.","After installing and opening VSRegex, developers can create expressions, adjust VSRegex's settings (using the extension's Options menu), and test their expressions. Developers can then save the expression they've created and the options they've specified in a VSRX file. This allows them to quickly load, edit, and use the expression at a later time."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/vsrx_13055.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .vsrx file in Microsoft Visual Studio","caption":"VSRX file open in Microsoft Visual Studio"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vsrx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
