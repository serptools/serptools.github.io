{"slug":"stop","extension":"stop","name":"STOP Ransomware Encrypted File","category":"stop-ransomware-encrypted-file","summary":"","developer_org":"n-a","developer_name":"N/A","more_information":{"description":["STOP ransomware, also known as STOP Djvu ransomware, is one of the most common types of ransomware. Typically, STOP ransomware encrypts users' files and produces a ransom message named _readme.txt , which contains instructions a user is supposed to follow to decrypt their files. The ransom message asks for a ransom of $980, unless the user contacts the ransomer in the first 72 hours after infection, in which case the ransom is halved to $490. Other variants of STOP ransomware append users' files with the .DJVU , .RUMBA , .RADMAN , .GERO , or .CADQ extensions.","STOP ransomware is most commonly distributed within \"free programs\" that are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and installed a \"free program\" (especially one that is meant to be a copy of a paid program) from a software download website, that may be how your computer became infected by STOP ransomware."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"stop.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
