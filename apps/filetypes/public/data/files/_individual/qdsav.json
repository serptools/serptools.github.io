The QDSAV file stores players' choices and tracks them, allowing the game to load the correct story path and character outcomes.","You will likely find QDSAV files stored in the game's local save directory on a computer or console ( C:\\​Users\\​[username]\\​Saved Games ). Most users never need to open or edit QDSAV files manually, as the game automatically reads and updates them. However, some advanced users or modders may back up these files or attempt to transfer them between systems to preserve their progress."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"qdsav.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
