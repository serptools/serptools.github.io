Primarily, these 1-bit engines are designed to emulate the audio capabilities of the ZX Spectrum, an 8-bit home computer that Sinclair Research released in 1982.","Each 1tracker engine, or 1TE file, defines the channels to which a user can add (and edit) notes while creating a 1tracker module ( .1TM file). It also contains other channel-related settings and a description of the engine's capabilities. 1tracker stores many default 1TE files in its engines directory. Users who create or download custom 1tracker engines should also store their 1TE files in this directory, so they can easily load them within 1tracker."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/1te_13315.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .1te file in Shiru 1tracker","caption":"1TE file open in Shiru 1tracker"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"1te.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
