It then forces them to pay the perpetrator (typically through Bitcoin) to recover their files.","The Locky virus is a trojan horse that typically enters a victim's computer through a spam email attachment. For example, the cybercriminal may send an email with a .DOCM file attachment with a macro embedded. Torrent websites and malicious advertisements are also common culprits.","Once the virus affects their computer, it scrambles, renames, and encrypts their files. The virus then generates the _WHAT_is.bmp and _WHAT_is.html files on the user's computer desktop and changes the desktop wallpaper. The files include messages informing the victim of the takeover and what they need to do to recover their files (typically by paying a Bitcoin ransom)."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"[8 random characters]-[4 random characters]-[4 random characters]-[4 random characters]-[12 random characters].thor","description":"[8 random characters]-[4 random characters]-[4 random characters]-[4 random characters]-[12 random characters].thor - Encrypted files are renamed with a sequence of random characters followed by the .thor file extension.
