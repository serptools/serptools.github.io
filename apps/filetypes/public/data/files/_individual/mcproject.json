It allows players to import existing Minecraft worlds (MCWORLD files) or templates ( .MCTEMPLATE files) or create a new world from scratch. Players can then edit the world's settings and contents, using a variety of editing tools.","If a player wants to retain a copy of their world project, to continue editing the world at a later date, they can save the project as an MCPROJECT file. MCPROJECT files open only in Bedrock Editor. To use the world an MCPROJECT file contains with Minecraft Bedrock Edition, players must export the world as an MCWORLD file (and then double-click it to import it into Minecraft).","NOTE: As of March 2023, Minecraft Bedrock Editor is available only in the Preview version of Minecraft Bedrock Edition for Windows."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mcproject.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
