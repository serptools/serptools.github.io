The structure of the registry includes registry keys that function similar to folders but instead of containing files, they contain values or other registry keys.","The REGLNK file is similar to the .LNK file, which contains a shortcut to a file or folder on a system. However, the REGLNK links to a registry key, which is useful for quickly navigating to the location of a registry key. You can open a REGLNK file using Registry Editor, a tool included with Windows that enables users to manually edit registry keys.","To open Registry Editor in Windows 10, type regedit in the taskbar search box, then select Registry Editor . Or, right-click the \"Start\" button, select Run , enter regedit in the \"Open:\" box, and click OK .","NOTE: Be careful when editing registry keys because incorrect modifications could disable your computer."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"reglnk.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
