  "summary": "An MP5 file is a video that is meant to be played on a Chinese MP5 portable media player. MP5 files are not significantly different from .MP4 files. Like MP4 files, MP5 files are encoded using the MPEG-4 or MPEG-H codecs. The only difference between MP5 files and MP4 files is that MP5 files are often encoded such that they are optimized for MP5 media players.",
