{"slug":"hexlic","extension":"hexlic","name":"Hex-Rays IDA License","category":"hex-rays-ida-license","summary":"","developer_org":"hex-rays","developer_name":"Hex-Rays","more_information":{"description":["IDA Pro and IDA Free are tools used by software reverse engineers, security researchers, and malware analysts to analyze compiled programs. When you install one of these tools, the software checks for a valid HEXLIC file to verify the license. Without this file, the software may run in a limited mode or refuse to launch.","Hex-Rays typically issues the HEXLIC file after a purchase or registration. However, you may also need to manually download the HEXLIC file by going to the License tab in the \"My Hex-Rays\" online portal, clicking the three dots under the Actions column , and then selecting Download hexlic from the dropdown menu.","You can then place the file in the same directory as the IDA executable ( ida64.exe or ida.exe ), typically in the IDA installation folder. Because the file is tied to software licensing, you should not edit or share it, as doing so may violate license terms."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"hexlic.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
