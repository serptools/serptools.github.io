You can also create artwork with Butterfly, including handwritten doodles.","The app automatically saves your progress to the BFLY file you created when starting the note. You can then close, re-open, and continue to modify your note. The app also allows you to export your notes to other more common image or document formats, which is helpful when sharing them.","NOTE: The desktop version of Butterfly saves BFLY files to the \"Documents\" folder, by default.
