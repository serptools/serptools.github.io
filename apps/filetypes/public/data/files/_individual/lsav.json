In Gallery, users can choose to hide videos and photos, so other users cannot view those files. The exact steps used to hide videos and photos vary in different versions of Gallery, but they always involve:","As Gallery moves the selected videos and photos to its private folder (located at ~/​MIUI/​Gallery/​cloud/​secretAlbum ), it encrypts them and changes their extensions to either .lsav (videos) or .LSA (photos). Because these files are encrypted and password-protected, they can be opened only from within Gallery, by accessing your private folder."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"lsav.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
