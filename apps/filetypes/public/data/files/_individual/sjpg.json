They had developed the Unsealer program to open the protected documents but the Unsealer program is no longer available. SJPG files can only be viewed with the Oracle IRM Desktop software, which facilitates the authorization rights management for the digital documents.","NOTE: Oracle IRM Desktop adds an \"s\" to the beginning of the file extension it is sealing. For example, .XML files sealed by IRM become .SXML files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"sjpg.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
