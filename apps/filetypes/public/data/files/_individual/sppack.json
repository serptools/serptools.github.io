These features were helpful for researchers and engineers working in telecommunications, linguistics, and acoustic analysis.","SPPACK was widely used in the 1980s and 1990s when Bell Labs was at the forefront of speech recognition and synthesis research. The format played a role in early text-to-speech systems, phonetic analysis, and voice compression techniques.","However, as digital signal processing advanced, newer, more standardized formats like .WAV , .MP3 , and .FLAC became dominant. Today, SPPACK files are rare; you will likely not encounter them outside of historical research or legacy data analysis in specialized fields."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"sppack.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
