If you need to open it there are a variety of programs for Windows that support the format, including Alcohol 120% and Daemon Tools. You can also convert the BWI format to a more common format, such as .ISO , with UltraISO. This is especially helpful if the BWI file needs to be opened by macOS user (there are no macOS applications that support the format).","BWI files were replaced with .B5I files when version 5 of BlindWrite was released. B5I files were then replaced by .B6I files with the release of BlindWrite 6."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"bwi.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
