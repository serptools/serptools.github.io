It allows students to plot functions, analyze numerical data, solve complex equations, and perform other mathematical operations.","Periodically, Texas Instruments releases updates for the TI-Nspire's operating system. Students (or their teachers) can use the TI-Nspire's associated desktop software, available for Windows and macOS, to update the calculator's operating system. To do so, they must first download the latest updates, saved as a TNO file, from Texas Instruments' website. Then, they can use the TI-Nspire Software to apply the updates the TNO file contains (as described in the TI-Nspire's guidebook)."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"tno.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
