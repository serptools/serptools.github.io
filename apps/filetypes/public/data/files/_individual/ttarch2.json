All Telltale games store game data in archives that use a proprietary file format.","In older games, these archives use the TTARCH format and .ttarch extension. In newer games, such as Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead, and Batman: The Telltale Series, these archives use the TTARCH2 format and .ttarch2 extension. While TTARCH and TTARCH2 files are formatted differently, player-created tools can extract files from both types of archives."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ttarch2.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
