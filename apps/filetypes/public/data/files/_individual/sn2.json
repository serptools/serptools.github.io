They can then use Drive Snapshot to retrieve or restore these backups' contents if needed.","If a drive's contents are large enough, Drive Snapshot will split those contents across multiple backup files: a primary SNA file and one or more backup continuation files. The continuation files use the same base filename as their associated SNA file, but the .sn1 , .sn2 , and so on extensions.","Users cannot view or restore data from continuation files alone. Instead, they must gather a backup's SNA file and all its continuation files and place them in the same directory, before attempting to view or restore data from their backup."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"sn2.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
