They may also include notes that provide context for information within the mind map. The primary purpose of mind maps is to organize information, such as brainstorming sessions and complex processes.","MindManager users typically save mind maps as .MMAP files, then apply themes saved as MMAS or XMMAS files to adjust the maps' appearance. For example, a user may use a dark, simple theme for business-related diagrams and a colorful theme for a personal diagram.","NOTE: The advantage of the MMAS binary format is that it requires less storage space. However, the XMMAS XML format is more transportable since other applications can more easily read it."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/xmmas_12594.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .xmmas file in Corel MindManager 22","caption":"XMMAS file open in Corel MindManager 22"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"xmmas.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
