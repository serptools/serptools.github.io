The Wii U version saves course data as .CDT files and the 3DS version saves course data as CDTC files. The second \"C\" in the file extension likely refers to \"CTR,\" the internal hardware model codename for the 3DS platform.","The proprietary CDT and CDTC formats are similar but not interchangeable. For example, the Wii U version of Super Mario Maker does not support CDTC files, and the 3DS version does not support CDTC files. Also, the CDTC format is compressed to adhere to 3DS requirements."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"cdtc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
