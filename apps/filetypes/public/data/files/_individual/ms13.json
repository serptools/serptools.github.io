You can simply double-click the MS13 file to open it in Multisim. MS13 files can be simulated in the software to analyze the circuit and combined into Multisim projects, which use the .MP13 extension.","Multisim appends a number to circuit design file extensions, which indicates the version of Multisim that created the design. For example, Multisim 11 uses the .MS11 file extension and Multisim 12 uses the .MS12 file extension for saving designs. Also, Multisim supports older project formats, which means that version 14 of Multisim can open an .MS9 design created by version 9 of Multisim.","Multisim provides a variety of features that make it a powerful electronic schematic capture and SPICE environment. It is used by educators, researchers, and engineers around the world to simulate and analyze PCBs."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ms13.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
