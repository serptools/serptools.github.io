A Gantt chart's Y-axis shows the time period in which a project will take place, and its X-axis lists the project's tasks and sub-tasks. Each bar on the chart represents the time period in which the corresponding task is meant to be worked on. As workers make progress on a task, project managers often shade in a corresponding percentage of that task's bar, to show how close the task is to completion.","Online Gantt is a free online tool that allows project managers to create, edit, and export Gantt charts. If an Online Gantt user knows they'll want to continue editing a chart they've created, they can save that chart as a GANTT file. This file contains JSON-formatted data that defines the chart's appearance and various project- and chart-related metadata (such as available project resources and chart settings)."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/gantt_13555.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .gantt file in Online Gantt","caption":"GANTT file open in Online Gantt"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"gantt.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
