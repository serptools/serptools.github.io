Most commonly, email programs such as Windows Live Mail mistakenly produce _XLSX files. This happens when a user attaches a spreadsheet whose filename ends in . to an email.","For example, if you attach a spreadsheet named spreadsheet..xlsx to an email, Windows Live Mail will rename that file to spreadsheet._xlsx . This issue also occurs when users attach .DOC , .DOCX , and .XLS files to emails.","While XLSX, and thus _XLSX, files are typically created by Microsoft Excel, they can also be created using other spreadsheet programs, such as OpenOffice Calc or Apple Numbers. After renaming your _XLSX file to use the .xlsx extension, you should be able to open the file in any of those programs."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"_xlsx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
