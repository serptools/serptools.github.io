Content provided via the Xbox Games Store (and before that, Xbox Live Marketplace) is sometimes saved in the XCP format.","Each XCP file is an encrypted .CAB archive that contains all a content package's resources and assets. Several Xbox 360 enthusiasts have attempted to create utilities that allow them to extract, view, and modify XCP files' contents. However, their efforts have largely been unsuccessful. Therefore, in most cases, you will not be able to open an XCP file to view its contents.","NOTE: Content provided via the original Xbox version of Xbox Live was also saved in the XCP format."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"xcp.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
