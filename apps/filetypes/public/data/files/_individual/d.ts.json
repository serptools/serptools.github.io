It uses static type checking to check programs for errors before running them. When a TypeScript program is compiled , it is compiled to JavaScript, making it easier for web browsers to run.","Developers creating TypeScript programs may want to access APIs written in plain JavaScript. To do so, the developer must create a D.TS file that declares that API's objects and functions. They can then add the API's .JS file as a source for their TypeScript program, alongside the corresponding D.TS file."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/d_ts_12989.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .d.ts file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"D.TS file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"d.ts.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
