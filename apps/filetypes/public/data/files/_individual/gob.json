LucasArts later reused and adapted the Jedi Engine for other titles, most notably Outlaws (1997), a western-themed shooter.","The game engine uses various proprietary file formats, including GOB, for storing bundled game assets. Now, the game engine is no longer used in modern game development, but it has become a target for modding communities interested in editing levels, textures, and audio in the Star Wars: Dark Forces and Outlaws games.","NOTE: GOB files are similar in function to the .PAK and .WAD game archive formats."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"gob.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
