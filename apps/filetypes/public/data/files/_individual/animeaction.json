Animators can create custom actions that control how a character moves in a frame and then apply them to characters.","In Moho, custom actions are saved and exported as .MOHOACTION files. In Anime Studio, custom actions were saved as ANIMEACTION files. However, the MOHOACTION and ANIMEACTION file formats are similar. With some adjustments, you can continue to use ANIMEACTION files in Moho."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/animeaction_10878.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .animeaction file in File Viewer for Mac","caption":"ANIMEACTION file open in File Viewer for Mac"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"animeaction.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
