As players move through the Minecraft world, Xaero's mod continuously creates or updates XAERO files (the files act as local map caches ) to reflect newly explored areas. Additionally, the mod saves XAERO files locally in the player's Minecraft directory, usually within the mod's configuration or data folder (e.g., XaeroWorldMap/â€‹ )."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"xaero.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
