The environment is similar to MIT Scratch , making it beginner-friendly and accessible for students or educators learning to program robots. For example, it teaches programming concepts without requiring prior experience in text-based coding languages.","The VEXcode V5 environment supports exporting V5BLOCKS projects for VEX V5 Brain hardware, allowing users to test and refine their robotic programs in real-world applications. Users can also switch from the block-based interface to text-based programming within VEXcode to work in more complex coding languages like Python or C++ (users can save those projects as .V5PYTHON and .V5CPP files)."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/v5blocks_13772.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .v5blocks file in VEX Robotics VEXcode V5","caption":"V5BLOCKS file open in VEX Robotics VEXcode V5"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"v5blocks.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
