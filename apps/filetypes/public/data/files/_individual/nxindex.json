When a user inserts the flashcart into a Switch, it loads games onto the Switch, but the Switch does not allow users to browse and select the games.","Instead, users must eject and reinsert the flashcart multiple times to change the game. Every time a user does this, the flashcart writes the order of the games to the NXINDEX file and saves it to the Micro SD card inserted in the flashcart."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"nxindex.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
