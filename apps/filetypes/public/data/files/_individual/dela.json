Each DELA file can include any number of words, as well as annotations describing those words' morphological information, part-of-speech tags, syntactic categories, semantic features, and more.","All DELA files list one entry (and its associated metadata) per line. However, DELA files' exact formatting may vary depending on how they are meant to be used. Therefore, you may need to refer to documentation provided by a DELA file's creator (usually a software developer or linguistics researcher) before you can use it."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"dela.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
