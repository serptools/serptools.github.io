This variant encrypts users' files and appends them with the .lqqw extension. The ransomware then produces a plain text ransom note named _readme.txt in every folder that contains an infected file. The note contains instructions users are meant to follow to decrypt their files.","Additionally, LQQW ransomware attempts to delete users' System Restore points and restrict access to certain web domains. The ransomware may also install a trojan that its creators can use to access your computer again at a later time. As such, it is highly recommended that you take action to remove the ransomware as soon as possible.","LQQW ransomware is most commonly distributed in programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and installed an unverified program, that may be how LQQM ransomware infected your computer.","NOTE: To learn more about STOP ransomware and its variants, refer to the .STOP entry."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"lqqw.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
