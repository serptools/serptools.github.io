Various applications utilize OpenGL, including Google Earth, Minecraft, and Adobe Photoshop.","FSH files contain data that shades a fragment, which is a pixel in a rasterized triangle that makes up a 3D image. When rendered by the GPU, the code in the FSH file determines the color (includes the saturation, hue, brightness, and contrast) of the pixels in the graphics.","NOTE: Fragment shaders differ from vertex shaders ( .VSH and .VERT files), which store vertex code required to manipulate the position of the triangle mesh vertices that make up a 3D model."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"fsh.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
