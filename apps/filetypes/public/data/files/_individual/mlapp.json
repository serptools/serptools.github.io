Engineers and scientists use MATLAB in various fields, including biological sciences, robotics, machine learning, wireless communications, risk management, and signal processing.","Among its many features, MATLAB provides an integrated development environment ( IDE ) that allows you to create apps. With this feature, you can design the layout and program the app's capabilities, then save it as an MLAPP file. When you want to share the app with other users, you can share it as an .MLAPPINSTALL file with other MATLAB users or compile it as a web or standalone desktop app.","To create an MLAPP file with MATLAB:","After saving the file, you can close it and re-open it for further editing. When you finish developing the app, select Share from the DESIGNER tab, then choose to share it as an MLAPPINSTALL file or compile it as a standalone desktop app or web app."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/mlapp_13289.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .mlapp file in The MathWorks MATLAB R2023a","caption":"MLAPP file open in The MathWorks MATLAB R2023a"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mlapp.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
