{"slug":"shbin","extension":"shbin","name":"Nintendo 3DS Shader Binary File","category":"nintendo-3ds-shader-binary-file","summary":"","developer_org":"nintendo","developer_name":"Nintendo","more_information":{"description":["Shaders are programs that produce shadows, lighting effects, and other special effects in 3D video games and other applications. Nintendo 3DS video games use shaders that are compiled and stored in SHBIN files. SHBIN files may contain vertex shaders (compiled from .VSH files) or geometry shaders (compiled from .GSH or .ASM files). Both types of shaders produce shading effects by manipulating in-game objects' vertices.","Most gamers will never encounter an SHBIN file. However, those who are interested in modding or examining 3DS games' structure may happen across SHBIN files in game dumps or online forums."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"shbin.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
