Publisher allows CAD users to export their 2D and 3D models in compressed and easy-to-open formats, so they can share the models over the Internet and with users who do not have access to CAD software.","EASMX is one of the formats in which users can choose to export their 3D models. EASMX files are, essentially, XPS (XML Paper Specification) files. The XPS format is Microsoft's version of the .PDF format. All Windows users can open XPS files in Microsoft XPS Viewer, and other users can open XPS files in other XPS viewers. So, all users should be able to open and view a model saved in an EASMX file, regardless of whether they have access to a CAD application.","However, it is best to view EASMX files in Dassault Systemes' free eDrawings Viewer. eDrawings Viewer provides additional viewing tools that allow users to switch between drawing views and examine models more closely. It also allows users to export drawings in other file formats, including the .STL format and various image file formats."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"easmx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
