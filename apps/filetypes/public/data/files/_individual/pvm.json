  "summary": "A PVM file is a virtual machine created by Parallels Desktop for Mac, a virtualization application that lets Mac users run other operating systems alongside macOS. A PVM file is saved as a macOS package, which appears as a single file in Finder but is actually a folder that contains all the components required to run a virtual machine (VM). PVM files allow users to run operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, or another version of macOS, on their Mac.",
