During development, these models are saved as MLMODEL files.","When a developer packages an app that includes an MLMODEL file for distribution, XCode compiles the MLMODEL file to the MLMODELC format. This optimizes the model for use on an Apple device. MLMODELC files are typically stored in an app's Resources directory.","NOTE: In some cases, an app may instead download and compile a Create ML model dynamically when a user runs that app."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mlmodelc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
