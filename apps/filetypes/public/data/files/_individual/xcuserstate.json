The IDE includes many tools for building, testing, and deploying apps. It also assists developers in managing feedback from app users.","Xcode automatically creates the XCUSERSTATE file to preserve the state of your workspace when you save an .XCWORKSPACE or .XCODEPROJ file (both files are macOS packages ). For example, when you save a workspace in Xcode by selecting File → New → Workspace , the software creates an XCWORKSPACE file. You can also create an XCWORKSPACE file from an open project by selecting File → Save As Workspace... . Regardless of how you save the file, Xcode creates an XCUSERSTATE file and saves it in the XCWORKSPACE file.","NOTE: You can delete the XCUSERSTATE file and Xcode will regenerate it. However, you will lose the state of the workspace previously saved."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/xcuserstate_13418.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .xcuserstate file in Apple Xcode 14","caption":"XCUSERSTATE file open in Apple Xcode 14"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"xcuserstate.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
