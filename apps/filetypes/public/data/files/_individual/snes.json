They then use emulators to simulate the SNES console and load the game content stored in the SNES file, allowing users to play the game as if it were running on the original hardware.","Some emulators also support features not available on the SNES, such as save states, screen filters, and controller remapping. While .snes is a valid file extension, SNES ROMs more commonly use the .smc ( .SMC file) and .sfc ( .SFC file) file extensions (depending on the source and emulator).","NOTE: While emulators are legal, downloading SNES files for games users do not own may violate copyright laws."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"snes.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
