{"slug":"vidomi","extension":"vidomi","name":"Vidomi Configuration File","category":"vidomi-configuration-file","summary":"","developer_org":"vidomi","developer_name":"Vidomi","more_information":{"description":["Vidomi is a free MPEG-2, DVD, and SVCD player and conversion tool that, among other things, allows users to convert videos to the DivX ( .DIVX ) and Xvid ( .XVID ) formats. Before they convert a video, users can specify many conversion-related settings by selecting Vidomi's Options button.","If a user wants to save their current Vidomi settings, so they can quickly load those settings when converting videos in the future, they can do so by selecting File â†’ Save Settings . This saves the user's current settings in a VIDOMI file. VIDOMI files are plain text files, but because settings are defined using variable numerical values, you likely should not edit a VIDOMI file's contents in a text editor. Instead, you should load the file in Vidomi and then edit its settings as necessary."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vidomi.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
