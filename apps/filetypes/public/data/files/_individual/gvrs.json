To help applications process that data, developer Gary Lucas began work on the Gridfour Software Project. The Gridfour Software Project's primary goal is to optimize the compression, processing, and analysis of large raster image data sets.","The Gridfour Software Project includes a module called the Gridfour Virtual Raster Store (GVRS). The GVRS API helps Java applications compress and manage raster image data that would typically be too large for a system to process. The API can save this compressed data in GVRS files, for future access and long-term archiving."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"gvrs.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
