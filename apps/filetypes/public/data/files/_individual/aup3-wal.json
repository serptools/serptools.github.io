AUP3 files are database files that store a project's included audio files, project settings, and metadata.","When a user creates or opens an AUP3 file, Audacity creates a corresponding AUP3-WAL file. This file is a temporary file that Audacity uses to store and write data to the user's AUP3 file. Audacity automatically deletes related AUP3-WAL files when a user closes an AUP3 file.","NOTE: The Windows and Linux versions of Audacity also create .AUP3-SHM temporary files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"aup3-wal.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
