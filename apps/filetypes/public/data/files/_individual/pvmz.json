When users create a VM with Parallels Desktop, the software creates a PVM file, which is a macOS package , to store its contents.","Since PVM files can grow large, users typically compress PVM files as PVMZ files to reduce their size. This functionality is only available in Parallels Desktop for Mac Pro and Business Editions.","To create a PVMZ file with Parallels Desktop, right-click the VM in Control Center, then select Archive . After archiving the VM, the PVM file becomes a PVMZ file in the same location."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/pvmz_10773.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .pvmz file in Parallels Desktop for Mac 20","caption":"PVMZ file open in Parallels Desktop for Mac 20"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"pvmz.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
