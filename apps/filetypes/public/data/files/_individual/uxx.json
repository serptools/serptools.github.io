  "summary": "A UXX file is a cache file used by Unreal Tournament, a popular first-person shooter game developed by Epic Games. When players access game assets during gameplay, such as maps, textures, and audio, Unreal Tournament temporarily stores this data in UXX cache files. The caching allows for faster access to recently used content, helping to reduce loading times and improve game performance by reusing resources rather than reloading them entirely from scratch.",
