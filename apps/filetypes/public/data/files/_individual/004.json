{"slug":"004","extension":"004","name":"Split Archive Part 4","category":"split-archive-part-4","summary":"","developer_org":"n-a","developer_name":"N/A","more_information":{"description":["While compressing files and combining them into an archive reduces their total file size, some archives can still end up having quite large file sizes. This makes uploading and sharing these archives via the internet difficult. For that reason, some archiving and file-splitting utilities allow users to split large archives into several pieces, comprised of files with sequential extensions ( .001 , .002 , .003 , .004 , and so on). Users can then upload and share these pieces individually, allowing them to circumvent online file size limits and make downloads easier on other users.","If you have happened upon a 004 file, the split archive of which it is a part likely contains at least three other files: a 001, 002, and 003 file. The archive may also include additional, successive pieces, such as a 005, 006, etc. file. You'll want to make sure you have all pieces of the split archive and have stored them all in the same directory before attempting to open the split archive."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"004.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
