It allows animators to create and edit simple animated scenes, before rendering and exporting those scenes as .MP4 or .WEBM video files.","When an animator creates a new theFrame project, the program saves that project as a TFRPROJ file. The TFRPROJ file is a plain text file that contains the data theFrame uses to animate a scene. For example, each element included in a theFrame animation is listed by name in that animation's TFRPROJ file, with a variety of data about that element (including its type, colors, and opacity) following its name."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"tfrproj.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
