Amiga users created floppy disk images saved in various formats, including the .ADF , .ADZ , and .DMS formats. In 2000, developer Vincent Joguin created the FDI disk image format, to make sharing data between Amiga users easier.","The FDI format is open-source , so most Amiga emulators can mount FDI disk images and access the data they contain. Also, unlike other Amiga disk images, FDI files can store raw low-level data, such as data required to support copy protection schemes. As such, FDI files are often larger than other Amiga disk images."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"fdi.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
