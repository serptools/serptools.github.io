However, both official Nintendo games and third-party games use the Bezel Engine.","Bezel Engine games contain game maps saved as NBMAP files. For example, Super Mario Party (Switch) contains an NBMAP file named bdr001_map_b02.nbmap .","The NBMAP files found in Switch video games are binary files. However, when being developed in the Bezel Engine, NBMAP files are XML files. The Bezel Engine converts NBMAP files to binary files when compiling a developer's game."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"nbmap.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
