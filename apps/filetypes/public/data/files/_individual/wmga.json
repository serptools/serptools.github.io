The advantage of WMGA files is that readers can download much smaller file sizes. Additionally, manga authors can update the remote content on-the-fly and have it distributed to all readers automatically. However, the disadvantage is that readers must allow the document to download on-demand as they read the comic.","Web manga document files are stored in a .ZIP format. Therefore, you can decompress them with any ZIP decompression utility.","NOTE: WMGA files can be created with the Manga Creator application that is included with the Manga Reader installation."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"wmga.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
