It allows users to play PSP games on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. One of the emulator's most helpful features is the ability to save progress using emulator-specific save states stored in PPST files, which is helpful for players who want to save their game at any time, not just at designated save points.","To create a PPST file, the user opens a game in PPSSPP and selects File → Save State File from the emulator menu under a designated slot. The emulator generates a PPST file, which is specific to the game and the version of the emulator used, and stores it in a corresponding \"save state\" folder (e.g., PPSSPP_STATE )."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ppst.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
