This prevents other users from opening the files and viewing their contents. For example, you might use Encrypt Easy to encrypt a .TXT document that contains your online banking credentials, so others cannot open it.","When Encrypt Easy encrypts a file, it saves that file with the .## extension. This allows Encrypt Easy users to easily recognize files they've encrypted."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"##.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
