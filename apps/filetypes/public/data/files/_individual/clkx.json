Words and phrases are pictured in grids, which are referred to as grid sets.","To create a grid set, Clicker users (or more likely, teachers or parents) select File → New Grid Set . They can then choose from different grid set templates, optimized for creating different types of grid sets. For example, Sentence Building templates are used to create preset sentence-writing grid sets, while Classifying templates are used to group similar words, pictures, and phrases together in a grid set.","After creating a grid set, a user can select File → Save Grid Set to save the grid set as a CLKX file. By default, Clicker stores CLKX files saved this way in its primary installation directory."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"clkx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
