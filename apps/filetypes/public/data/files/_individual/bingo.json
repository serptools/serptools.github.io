It includes additional blocks and features that the default version of Scratch 1.4 does not. For example, Bingo includes four additional categories of blocks, and it allows developers to compile their Scratch programs into .EXE files, so they can execute the programs on Windows.","Bingo development projects are saved as BINGO files. While BINGO files are similar to Scratch 1.0's .SB files, Scratch 1.0 cannot open BINGO files. Only Bingo can open BINGO files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"bingo.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
