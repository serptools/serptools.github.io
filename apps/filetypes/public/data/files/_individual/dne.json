These networks enable users to make informed decisions in fields that involve uncertainty, such as medical diagnosis, risk analysis, fault detection, and environmental modeling.","Netica users create DNE files to save Bayesian network models. The files typically contain information about the network's nodes (variables), their possible states, the links between nodes, and conditional probability tables (CPTs) that define how the state of one variable influences the state of another. When users build networks within Netica's graphical interface, the software generates and saves the network structure and data in a DNE file."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"dne.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
