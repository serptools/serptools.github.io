{"slug":"wkdownload","extension":"wkdownload","name":"Epiphany Partially Downloaded File","category":"epiphany-partially-downloaded-file","summary":"","developer_org":"the-gnome-project","developer_name":"The GNOME Project","more_information":{"description":["While Epiphany is in the process of downloading a file, it assigns that file the .wkdownload extension in place of its actual extension. For example, an .MP4 file that is not yet fully downloaded uses the .wkdownload extension in place of .mp4 . This denotes that the file is not yet available to open or use.","After Epiphany finishes downloading a file, it automatically replaces the .wkdownload extension with the file's actual extension. Therefore, if you see a WKDOWNLOAD file in your Downloads folder (or elsewhere), it's likely that you paused an Epiphany download before it finished or the download was otherwise interrupted."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"wkdownload.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
