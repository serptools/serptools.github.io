This modified version saves game maps as STBSP files, rather than BSP files.","Despite the formats' shared origins, programs that can decompile BSP files cannot decompile STBSP files. As such, game modders cannot modify existing STBSP files or create their own."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"stbsp.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
