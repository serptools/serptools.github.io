For example, existing formats could not include intra-document links or embedded tactile graphics. The eBRF format solves these problems by saving documents as a series of XHTML files, rather than .TXT files, which can be styled using CSS and include embedded images. All the files that comprise an eBRF document are zipped together and saved as a single EBRF file.","At the same time as the American Printing House for the Blind began work on eBRF, the group also began creating a new multiline braille display that could load EBRF files. At the time of this writing, neither eBRF nor its associated reader are finalized."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ebrf.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
