For example, a Windows program might use a DLL file to communicate with external devices or read and write certain files.","Some programs' DLL files are accompanied by DLL.SIG files. These files typically have a similar filename as their associated DLL files. For example, the Windows version of Google Chrome includes a DLL file named widvinecdm.dll and a DLL.SIG file named widevinecdm.dll.sig .","Each DLL.SIG file contains a digital signature that an app developer generated using a private cryptographic key. The app uses this digital signature to verify that the associated DLL has not been tampered with, before using the code stored in that DLL."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"dll.sig.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
