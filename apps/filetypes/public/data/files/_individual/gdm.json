Notably, BWSB was included in MegaZeux, a game creation system that was also available for MS-DOS.","Music created to be played by BWSB was saved as GDM files. These files describe the notes a song contains, how those notes are arranged, and the instruments used to play those notes."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/gdm_13377.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .gdm file in MilkyTracker","caption":"GDM file open in MilkyTracker"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"gdm.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
