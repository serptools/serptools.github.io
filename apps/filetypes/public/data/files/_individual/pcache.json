For example, Unity users can use that program's pCache Tool to create PCACHE meshes and textures.","Each PCACHE file contains a list of points that comprise the object the file describes. Each point may have position, velocity, color, size, age, and lifetime data associated with it. The point data PCACHE files contain may be saved in an ASCII or binary format.
