The ransomware may be used on all types of computer users to take their files hostage and hold them for ransom until the users pay the cybercriminals.","The Salma virus may be introduced when you download and run a trojan horse program disguised as a safe application or update. Or, you may open a malicious email attachment file. To prevent attacks like these, never open email messages from unverified senders or run programs unless you verify the developer.","Once introduced to your computer, the virus takes your files hostage by encrypting them and adding the .salma extension onto the names of your files. Any type of file may be encrypted, such as images, videos, presentations, spreadsheets, and documents. For example, an image.jpg file becomes image.jpg.salma .","The virus then generates a read_me.txt file in every folder that stores an infected file. The .TXT files are ransom notes that provide information explaining the hostile takeover of your files and how you can recover your files by paying a ransom (FileInfo does not recommend paying a ransom)."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"salma.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
