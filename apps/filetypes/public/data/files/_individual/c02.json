When splitting an archive, WinAce creates multiple files depending on the size of the archive and the split archive size specified by the user. The first split archive is saved with the .c01 file extension, the second is saved with the .c02 file extension, and so on."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"c02.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
