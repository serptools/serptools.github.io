Each of these games was named for the console on which it was played (e.g. Minecraft for Wii U). These games, which are collectively referred to as Minecraft: Legacy Console Edition, have since been replaced by the multiplatform Minecraft Bedrock Edition.","Minecraft: Legacy Console Edition games store some game audio in MSSCMP files. Notably, these files do not contain in-game music. While most players will never encounter or need to open an MSSCMP file, Minecraft: Legacy Console Edition modders have created tools that allow them to open MSSCMP files and extract or replace the audio they contain.","NOTE: Various other games use audio archives saved in the MSSCMP format. Developers create MSSCMP files using Miles Sound System, a middleware tool initially developed by John Miles in 1991 and then acquired by Epic Games (formerly RAD Game Tools) in 1995."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"msscmp.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
