These elements tell MSBuild what items to build and how to build them. Some of the elements DBPROJ files contain include:","To build a database application developed in Visual Studio, a developer invokes MSBuild.exe from the Windows command-line interface along with the name of their DBPROJ file. For example, to build a project named MyProject.dbproj , a developer would enter the command MSBuild.exe MyProject.dbproj in the command prompt, along with any other appropriate command-line options.","NOTE: DBPROJ files have largely been replaced by .SQLPROJ files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"dbproj.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
