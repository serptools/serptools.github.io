For example, if you have a folder of sensitive financial information that you don't want to allow others to access, you can use Privacy Protector to encrypt that folder and the files it contains.","After Privacy Protector encrypts a folder or file, it renames that folder or file to use the PPENC extension. This reminds users that the folder or file has been encrypted, and must be decrypted (and unlocked, if password-protected) before it can be opened and used.","NOTE: Ashampoo Privacy Protector was later renamed to Ashampoo Magical Security."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ppenc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
