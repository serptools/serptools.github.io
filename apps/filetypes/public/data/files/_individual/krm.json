These vibrations are controlled by Mario Kart Wii's KRM file, which is named vibration.krm . Vibration.krm contains binary data that specifies when and how Mario Kart Wii players' Wiimotes should vibrate.","Most Mario Kart Wii players will never encounter vibration.krm . However, those who enjoy modding Mario Kart Wii can extract vibration.krm from the game's Common.szs file and edit it using player-created mod tools."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"krm.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
