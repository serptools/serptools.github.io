Typically, Synthesia users use the app along with a MIDI keyboard and one or more .MIDI or .MUSICXML files. This allows them to play songs on a real piano keyboard and import any song saved in the MIDI or MUSICXML format.","Optionally, Synthesia users can create SYNTHESIA files, which contain metadata for one or more MIDI or MUSICXML files. These files usually specify songs' identifying information and any finger hints or hand parts that a user added to those songs.","Primarily, Synthesia users create SYNTHESIA files with Synthesia Metadata Editor, a separate, free companion application. To create a SYNTHESIA file from your existing songs, select File â†’ Import data from Synthesia... .","To use a SYNTHESIA file with Synthesia, users should place it in the directory that contains the song(s) with which it is meant to be used. Synthesia will then load the metadata the file contains along with the accompanying song(s)."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/synthesia_13351.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .synthesia file in Synthesia Metadata Editor","caption":"SYNTHESIA file open in Synthesia Metadata Editor"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"synthesia.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
