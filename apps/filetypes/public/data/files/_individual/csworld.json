Players create and load Terraria worlds from the game's Select World screen.","In versions 1.2 and below of Terraria for Android, players can save the worlds they create to their Google Drive account, as CSWORLD files. This allows them to easily save and transfer worlds between Android devices.","However, in version 1.3 of Terraria for Android, the game began saving worlds as WLD files, to be consistent with the desktop versions of Terraria. When a player upgrades from version 1.2 to version 1.3 or above, Terraria for Android typically automatically converts their CSWORLD files to WLD files. However, players can also convert CSWORLD files to WLD files themselves, by following the steps below."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"csworld.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
