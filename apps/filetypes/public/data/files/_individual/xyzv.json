Instead, they are often generated by universe trajectory algorithms.","XYZV files are often referenced by .SSC catalog files, which define space entities. Any XYZV files that are referenced by an SSC file must be saved to a \\​data\\​ directory within the directory that the SSC file resides. For example, if cassini.ssc is stored in the \\​extras-standard\\​cassini\\​ directory, then all cassini XYZV files should be stored in the \\​extras-standard\\​cassini\\​data\\​ directory."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"xyzv.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
