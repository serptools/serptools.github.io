Developers creating iOS applications can use Interface Builder to link multiple related screens together in a single STORYBOARD file. Doing so allows them to quickly view and test their app's various workflows.","When a developer who created a STORYBOARD file builds their iOS app, Xcode compiles the STORYBOARD file into a STORYBOARDC file. Typically, this file contains multiple .NIB files, which represent the individual screens and elements included in the STORYBOARD file."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"storyboardc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
