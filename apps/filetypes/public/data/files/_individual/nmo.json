After infecting a user's computer, this malware encrypts the user's files and produces a ransom note named info.txt . The note contains instructions users can supposedly follow to decrypt their files.","Unlike most other forms of ransomware, NMO ransomware inserts the attacker's email address in encrypted files' extensions. Presumably, this is to make it easier, and thus more tempting, for victims to contact the attacker and pay their ransom.","NMO ransomware is most commonly distributed within email attachments and programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually malicious. If you recently downloaded and opened an unverified email attachment or program, that may be how your computer became infected by NMO ransomware."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"nmo.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
