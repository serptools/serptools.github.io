The game includes a default set of levels, but players can also create their own levels using the game's Level Editor.","When making a level, players first import the song (or other audio file) they want to be used in that level. They then add characters, rhythm prompts, special effects, dialogue, and other items to the level.","If a player wants to share their level with other players, they can do so by selecting File â†’ Export . This saves the level as an RDZIP file. Players commonly upload RDZIP files to custom level websites, such as rhtyhm.cafe , so other players can find and download them."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"rdzip.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
