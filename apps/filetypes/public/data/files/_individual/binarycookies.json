These files are stored in the app's private directory, while the operating system manages Safari's BINARYCOOKIES separately.","NOTE: iOS apps that include embedded web views are mobile applications on iPhones and iPads that display web content directly within the app using a built-in browser window (rather than opening Safari or another external browser)."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"Cookies.binarycookies","description":"Cookies.binarycookies - The filename used by all BINARYCOOKIES files."}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"binarycookies.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
