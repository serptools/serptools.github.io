When the correct codec is unavailable to play the PMB or WMM video project files, they are converted into a folder that contains a VMLT and .VMLF file. If this occurs, open the VMLT file with the GSpot utility, which tells you about the file and whether the codecs are installed.","NOTE: VMLT files are the same as VMLF files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vmlt.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
