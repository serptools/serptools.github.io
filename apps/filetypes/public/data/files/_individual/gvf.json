This allows those viewing thermal images to \"see\" temperature variations between and within objects.","Gensys Genvision is a thermal imaging software suite that allows users to capture thermal imaging videos. It saves these videos, and accompanying data about detected emissions, as GVF files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"gvf.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
