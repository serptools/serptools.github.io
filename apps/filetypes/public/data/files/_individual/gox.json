Developers use gccgo to compile and build Go programs.","When a developer uses gccgo to compile a file that exports functions, they can choose to store a description of those exported functions in a GOX file. This file functions similarly to a C or C++ .H file. When a developer uses gccgo to compile a file that imports the exported functions, gccgo searches for an accompanying GOX file (or SO, A, or O file, if a GOX file isn't found) and uses it to import the functions correctly."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"gox.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
