  "summary": "An A3P file is a 3D animation created using Alice 3, the third iteration of the Alice programming language and integrated development environment (IDE). It contains source code that defines the animation's environment, characters, objects, and movements. However, A3P files are binary files, so you cannot view the code they contain in a text or source code editor. To view the animation and code an A3P file contains, you must open it in Alice 3.",
