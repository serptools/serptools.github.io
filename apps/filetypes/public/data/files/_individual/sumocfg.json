The file type is only meant to be used with the SUMO simulator.","Typically, the XML files referenced in SUMOCFG files are NET.XML and ROU.XML files, but there may also be additional XML files referenced. The NET.XML file contains information about roads and intersections in the simulation, while the ROU.XML file contains information about routes, vehicles, and vehicle types.","SUMO, which stands for \"Simulation of Urban MObility,\" is available as a package of command line programs. To open a SUMOCFG file in SUMO, type -c [path to file and filename] or --configuration-file [path to file and filename] .","The software is also available with a graphical user interface GUI , which is called SUMO-GUI. To open a SUMOCFG file with the SUMO-GUI version, select File â†’ Open Simulation... and choose the SUMOCFG file.","NOTE: SUMO was originally developed by employees of the Institute of Transportation Systems at the German Aerospace Center. They then moved the codebase to Eclipse."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"sumocfg.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
