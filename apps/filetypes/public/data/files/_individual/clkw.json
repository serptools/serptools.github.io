(Advanced users can also use an in-app keyboard.) The app includes a Pop-up Word Bank feature, which allows users to open a default word bank that contains common words.","These pop-up word banks are saved as CLKW files (in contrast to normal grid sets, which are saved as .CLKX files). Users create CLKW files by opening their current pop-up word bank, editing it, and selecting File â†’ Save Word Bank As . By default, Clicker stores word banks in its Word Banks directory.","NOTE: A user's pop-up word bank can also be set to open from within a grid set, using the Add Pop-up Grid tool."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"clkw.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
