The \"Queuing\" aspect allows messages to be stored in a queue in the event that an application receiving a message from a sending application is currently inaccessible. When the application becomes accessible again, the messages waiting in the queue are then sent to the application. An example usage of this protocol is in eCommerce where sales need to be processed by different applications on different networks.","Messages that are communicated between applications are stored in MQ files. These files may contain messages from a single queue or from multiple queues. MQ files may grow up to 4 MB in size, then another MQ file is generated. Since messages may occur over a long span of time, information is written to LG1 and LG2 files to log the state of the MQ file in case anything happens to it.","You will most likely only encounter an MSMQ LG1 file if you are a developer of a system that utilizes MSMQ and are exploring the MSMQ\\â€‹Storage folder. This folder also contains one or more MQ files for which the LG1 and LG2 files were created to store logs.","NOTE: The MSMQ messaging protocol was developed by Microsoft and introduced in Windows NT 4 and Windows 95."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"MQInSeqs.lg1","description":"MQInSeqs.lg1 - Contains a log of messages by connected applications."},{"filename":"MQTrans.lg1","description":"MQTrans.lg1 - Contains a log of transaction operations between application."}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"lg1.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
