These enthusiasts can then share their songs with others or include them in their own, homebrew NES games.","Each FamiStudio song project is saved as an FMS file. These files describe a song's included tracks, patterns, samples, notes, and instruments.","When opened in FamiStudio, FMS files appear as a series of color-coded blocks (patterns), with notes arranged within each block. In FamiStudio, users can edit and play the song an FMS file describes, and they can export the song in a variety of audio, video, project, and code formats."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/fms_13329.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .fms file in BleuBleu FamiStudio","caption":"FMS file open in BleuBleu FamiStudio"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"fms.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
