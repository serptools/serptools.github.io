Combined, MADRIX's hardware and software allow lighting operators to design and control sophisticated LED displays, used at concerts, clubs, and other venues.","MADRIX's lighting control software includes a tool called the MIDI Remote Editor. The MIDI Remote Editor allows lighting operators to create sets of pre-programmed commands they can use to control lighting installations. Operators then associate these commands, saved within an MMRC file, with the buttons on a MIDI remote control. Using their remotes, operators can easily synchronize lighting sequences with other elements of an event or display, including audio and video."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mmrc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
