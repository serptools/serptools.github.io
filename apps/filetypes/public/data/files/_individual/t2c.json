{"slug":"t2c","extension":"t2c","name":"TCP/Com Configuration File","category":"tcp-com-configuration-file","summary":"","developer_org":"tal-technologies","developer_name":"TAL Technologies","more_information":{"description":["TCP/Com is used to collect data from scientific devices, such as sensors and meters, connected to the RS232 port on a computer and send the data to a TCP/IP port on a network. This functionality allows you to turn your computer into a serial device server, that can send data to multiple applications on other computers in a network. When you create a configuration as a T2C, you can save it and reopen it in TCP/Com instead of having to create the configuration from scratch again.","NOTE: TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and is used to interconnection network devices on the Internet."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"t2c.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
