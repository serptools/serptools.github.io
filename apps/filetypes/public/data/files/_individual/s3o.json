Therefore, you will likely only find them in the installation directory of a Spring RTS game.","While most gamers will never encounter S3O files, modders may open and edit them and place them back in the original location. Modders may also create S3O files from scratch or other 3D models and export them as S3O files for game use."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"s3o.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
