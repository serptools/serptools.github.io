Games that use AAL contain audio and audio-related files saved in a variety of proprietary file formats, including the .BARS , .BARSLIST , .BAMTA , and BLAL formats.","BLAL files are metadata files that contain a list of CRC32 hashes . Games use the hashes that BLAL files contain to verify that looped audio files (such as in-game background music) contain the correct data upon each loop."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"blal.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
