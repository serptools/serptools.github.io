While ANIMEPROJ files should be opened in Anime Studio Pro or Debut, you can directly open the file by extracting them from ANIME files. To do this, rename the \".anime\" extension with the \".zip\" extension, then extract the contents with the decompression program. You can then use a text editor to open the ANIMEPROJ file.","NOTE: Anime Studio was renamed as Moho with the release of version 12."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"animeproj.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
