This convention allows multiple versions of library files to exist while only one of them is referenced and used by the operating system's dynamic library loader. This helps avoid situations where many implementations of the same library are used at the same time.","NOTE: Shared library files may also use extensions such as \".so.1,\" \".so.2,\" and \".so.3.\""]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"so.0.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
