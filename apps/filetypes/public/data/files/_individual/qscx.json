This variant encrypts users' files and appends them with the .qscx extension. This prevents users from opening and using the files.","The ransomware then produces a plain text ransom note named _readme.txt in every folder that contains an infected file. The note contains instructions users are meant to follow to decrypt their files.","QSCX ransomware is most commonly distributed within \"free programs\" that are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and installed a \"free program\" (especially one that is meant to be a copy of a paid program) from a software download website, that may be how your computer became infected by QSCX ransomware.","NOTE: To learn more about STOP ransomware and its variants, refer to the .STOP entry."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"qscx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
