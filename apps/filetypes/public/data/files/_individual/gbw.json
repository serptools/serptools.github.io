The software helps them visualize, verify, and convert Gerber and Drill files before sending them for production.","Saving projects as GBW files allows users to close and reopen their work without reloading multiple individual Gerber files manually. This is especially helpful when managing complex layer configurations across multiple files while reviewing or preparing designs for manufacturing."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"gbw.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
