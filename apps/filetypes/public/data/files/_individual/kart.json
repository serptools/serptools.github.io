Various independent developers and community contributors (known as the \"SRB2Kart development team\") maintain the game and format, which they introduced in 2018.","Players typically download KART files from community websites, forums, or modding repositories and load them into the game to modify or enhance the gameplay experience. For example, SRB2Kart hosts can load KART files in multiplayer sessions to enable custom content for all connected players.
