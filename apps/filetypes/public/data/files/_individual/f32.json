Since it's uncompressed and high precision, F32 files are typically very large in size, making them less suitable for casual listening or distribution but ideal for mastering, editing, and detailed sound design work where preserving the audio's full quality is essential. Users typically convert or export F32 files into more common formats like WAV or FLAC once they finish editing them."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"f32.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
