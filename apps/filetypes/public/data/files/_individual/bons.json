It is reskinned and contains some custom programming blocks that the default version of Scratch 1.4 does not include. While Scratch 1.4 saves developers' programming projects as .SB files, Bones saves them as BONS files. Developers can open BONS files in Bones just as they would open an SB file in Scratch 1.4."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"bons.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
