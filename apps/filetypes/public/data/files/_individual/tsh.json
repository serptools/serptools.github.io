When recording audio with a compatible JNC digital recorder, the recorder saved audio in the TSH format.","To export the audio to a computer, users connected the recorder to their computer via a USB cable, transferred the TSH file(s), and then played the file(s) with JNC software packaged with their voice recorder purchase. Since JNC no longer produces digital recorders, the TSH file type has become obscure."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"tsh.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
