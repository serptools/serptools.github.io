However, beginning with Mac OS X 10.0 Cheetah in 2001, versions of Photoshop for Mac use .PLUGIN packages instead of 8BE files.","Photoshop plugins add various features to enhance its functionality, such as image filters, effects, or export options not included in the standard version of the software. Examples of plugin files supported by older Photoshop versions include .8BF files for image filters and .8BI files for supporting additional file types.","NOTE: PhotoDeluxe also supports 8BE plugins.
