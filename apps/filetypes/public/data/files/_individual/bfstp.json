This allows the program to output the data more quickly (reducing lag time) when it is actually needed.","Various Wii U and Switch video games use BFSTP files to prefetch audio data (such as in-game background music). This allows the games to seamlessly play the start of an audio track while loading the rest of the track. Examples of games that use BFSTP files include Splatoon 2, Kart 8, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, ARMS, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"bfstp.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
