The file extensions use a numerical value for the version of the Z-machine that is used to run them. Examples include the .Z1 , .Z3 , .Z4 , .Z5 , .Z6 , .Z7 , and .Z8 extensions. Since version 8 was the last Z-machine version, Z8 is the most popular of the extensions.","NOTE: Z2 and Z1 files are extremely rare, since very few games were released in the first and second versions of the Z-machine."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"z2.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
