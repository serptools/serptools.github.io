However, if you want to install an application not available on the Liferay Marketplace you must install the application manually. To install an application in Liferay, select Control Panel → Apps → App Manager , and click Install . An alternative method is to place the app in the [Liferay_Home]/deploy folder and it will be automatically deployed to the marketplace subfolder and installed."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"lpkg.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
