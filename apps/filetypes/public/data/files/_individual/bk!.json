The word processor uses BK! files as live backups, meaning the program updates the file in real time as you type or make changes.","The BK! backup files are especially useful if the program crashes or your computer shuts down unexpectedly. In such cases, you can use the BK! file to recover the unsaved work and continue editing without starting over."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"bk!.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
