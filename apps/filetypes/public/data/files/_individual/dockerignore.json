When building an application with Docker, developers may want to tell Docker to ignore certain files and directories included in the application's project directory. (Ignoring these files and directories speeds up the build process, by avoiding sending unnecessary files to Docker's build client.)","To do so, developers create a DOCKERIGNORE file. Each DOCKERIGNORE file is a plain text file that typically begins with the text # .dockerignore and then specifies the list of files and directories the Docker build client should ignore when building the associated application. Usually, developers create a single DOCKERIGNORE file for use with each app project, and they place it in the app's root directory. However, in some cases, developers may end up creating multiple DOCKERIGNORE files for use with a project (e.g., if the project uses multiple Dockerfiles)."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":".dockerignore","description":".dockerignore - The default name for DOCKERIGNORE files stored in a Docker project's root directory."}],"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/dockerignore_13524.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .dockerignore file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"DOCKERIGNORE file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"dockerignore.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
