Rules are the rules included in the document, whereas the external rules are the rules stored outside of the document and Inventor. These external rules are typically stored in ILOGICVB files. Although, they can also be stored in .VB or .TXT files.","To create a rule, click the \"Manage\" tab on the ribbon, then select the \"iLogic\" panel, and click \"Add Rule\", name the rule, and select \"OK\". To create an external rule, open a rule, copy the code, and then paste the code in an external rule created from the iLogic Browser \"External Rules\" tab. You can then save the external rule as an ILOGICVB file. To edit an external rule, simply open the \"Edit Rule\" dialog box and double-click the rule in the tree."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ilogicvb.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
