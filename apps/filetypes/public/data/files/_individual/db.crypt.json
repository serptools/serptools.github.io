These files are encrypted database files. To prevent hackers and other malicious entities from being able to decrypt DB.CRYPT files, WhatsApp regularly updates the encryption used to create the files. Every time WhatsApp updates DB.CRYPT files' encryption, they append a new number to the files' extensions. For example, .CRYPT6 , .CRYPT8 , .CRYPT10 , .CRYPT12 , and .CRYPT14 files are all WhatsApp message backup files.","WhatsApp also creates .CRYPT1 backup files, which contain a record of a user's sent and received stickers, chat settings, and contact status rankings. These files' extension does not change.","DB.CRYPT files that are message history backups are stored in the /​sdcard/​WhatsApp/​Databases directory. DB.CRYPT files that are sticker, chat settings, and status ranking backups are stored in the /​sdcard/​WhatsApp/​Backups directory.","If you need to free up space on your SD card, you can delete many of your DB.CRYPT files without affecting WhatsApp or your message history. However, you should always keep your most recent one or two chat backups (as noted by the date prepended to the files' names), and you should keep all your CRYPT1 files."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"msgstore.db.crypt","description":"msgstore.db.crypt - The name of the common database file used by WhatsApp Messenger to store chat messages."}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"db.crypt.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
