The difference between the two programs is that Indigo RT offers fewer features and is less expensive. Also, Indigo Renderer is available as a standalone application or as a plugin for other 3D CAD programs.","You can create an IGQ file with Indigo Renderer or Indigo RT to save a queue to share with another Indigo user or save it for later use. The PIGQ format packs the IGQ file as a .ZIP archive to reduce the queue file size.","You can view the render queue for your scenes, materials, etc., by selecting \"Render Queue\" from the dropdown menu in the \"Render Settings\" pane. In the Render Queue, you can add and remove scenes and adjust other settings, such as the scene and output paths and halt settings.","To create a PIGQ file with Indigo Renderer or Indigo RT, select File â†’ Save Queue , then choose \"Packed Indigo Queue\" from the file type dropdown menu."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"pigq.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
