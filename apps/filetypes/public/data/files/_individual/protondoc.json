Proton Drive is Proton's encrypted cloud storage service, designed to protect files and documents from unauthorized access while enabling private sharing and syncing across devices.","When you create a new document in Proton Drive using the built-in Proton Docs editor, the app saves it as a PROTONDOC file. If you open an existing text-based file, such as a .DOCX or .TXT , in Proton Docs, a new PROTONDOC version is generated for editing within the encrypted environment."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/protondoc_13853.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .protondoc file in Proton Drive","caption":"PROTONDOC file open in Proton Drive"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"protondoc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
