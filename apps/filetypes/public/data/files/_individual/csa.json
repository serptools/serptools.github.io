  "summary": "A CSA file is a game archive used by various games built with the Pixel Tales game engine, such as the horse-themed Star Stable Online, Star Academy, and Star Stable games. It stores multiple game data files, which typically include PME, PTE, and PCO files that may contain 3D models and textures, audio, game scripts, and UI elements. CSA files are compressed and encrypted to reduce the size of the game data files and protect them from being modified.",
