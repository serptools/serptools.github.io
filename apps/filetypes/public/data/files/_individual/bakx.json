Finale 2014 and later versions save these scores as .MUSX files. By default, whenever a user saves a MUSX file, Finale automatically creates a backup of that file. The backup is stored in the following directory:","~/​Documents/​Finale Files/​Backups","Each backup uses the same filename as the MUSX file from which it was created, except that the backup's filename ends with bak.musx to denote that it is a backup. Finale users and documentation often refer to these backup files as BAKX files, even though they use the .musx extension.","If you want to stop Finale from creating BAKX files:","NOTE: Older versions of Finale save backups as .BAK files."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/bakx_9073.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .bakx file in MakeMusic Finale","caption":"BAKX file open in MakeMusic Finale"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"bakx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
