Wii. Because Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii is an unofficial sequel, players can open, examine, and modify many of its game files if they so choose.","KPMAP files are map files that Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii uses to show the game's overall map and world maps to players. These maps allow players to travel from level to level within the game. If players are content with Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii's level structure, they do not have to open or edit the game's KPMAP files. However, those who are interested in modding Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii can use the Koopatlas Map Editor, a tool created and published in tandem with Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii, to edit KPMAP files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"kpmap.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
