The document that defined these standards was Allied Data Publication (ADatP) 4778.","As part of defining these standards, the NSO created the BDO file format. BDO files contain XML-formatted information used to bind (associate) a data object with a metadata label. This binding may be either a detached or encapsulating binding."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"bdo.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
