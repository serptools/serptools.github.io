It is included with many Unix distributions (including macOS) and also available for Windows.","While reading a text file in less, users can search for text within the document. To do so, they use the program's search commands (by pressing the / or ? keys) and then enter the text for which they want to search.","By default, less stores a record of a user's text searches in a LESSHST file. This allows the user to both view all the searches they've performed and quickly resume their last-conducted search (by pressing the n or N key). Less typically stores its LESSHST file in the user's home directory.","NOTE: To stop less from creating a LESSHST file, set the LESSHISTFILE variable to - ."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"lesshst.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
