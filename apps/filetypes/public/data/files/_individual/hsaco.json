Developers create the files by compiling source code written in languages, like C++ , with GPU-specific extensions.","Instead of targeting a CPU , the compiler generates code meant to be executed directly by the GPU. Each HSACO file is tailored for a specific GPU architecture, which helps optimize performance on that hardware.","NOTE: The Heterogeneous System Architecture Foundation (HSA Foundation) maintains the Heterogeneous System Architecture Code Object (HSACO) format."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"hsaco.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
