When developers want to work on multiple, related projects in VS Code at the same time, they can group those projects into a multi-root workspace. Doing so allows developers to open and switch between related projects using VS Code's EXPLORER sidebar, rather than opening each project in a separate instance of VS Code.","For example, a developer who wants to simultaneously open and edit an app's source code and its documentation can add both projects to a multi-root workspace. Then, as the developer updates the app's source code, they can update the app's documentation to reflect those code changes.","When a user saves a multi-root workspace (by selecting File â†’ Save Workspace As... from VS Code's menu bar), the workspace is saved as a CODE-WORKSPACE file. This file is a JSON file that contains a list of the root directories the workspace includes. When a user loads a workspace, VS Code uses these references to determine which folders to show in the EXPLORER sidebar.","To add a folder to a Visual Studio Code workspace:","The folder will then be added to your Visual Studio Code workspace."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/code-workspace_11896.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .code-workspace file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"CODE-WORKSPACE file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"code-workspace.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
