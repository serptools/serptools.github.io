In 2009, Mojang released an early online version of the game, which players could play in their web browser. Players often refer to this version (which is now largely discontinued) as Minecraft Classic.","Classic included the ability to save a player's current game world as a MINE file. This allowed players to store their saved games locally and resume them in Minecraft Classic at a later time. Some Minecraft enthusiasts still possess MINE files, and they have figured out ways to continue using the files with Minecraft Classic and convert the files to modern Minecraft world formats.","NOTE: While there is a rereleased, tenth-anniversary version of Minecraft Classic available online, that version does not allow players to create or load MINE files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mine.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
