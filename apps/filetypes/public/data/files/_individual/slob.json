Each blob represents a dictionary entry or data chunk, and the format indexes them using keys (like words or terms). This structure makes lookups of definitions, translations, and other reference content offline fast and efficient, even in large files.","Most users of SLOB files are researchers, language learners, translators, or anyone who needs offline access to dictionary or reference content. Developers and contributors may also create SLOB files from source content using tools that convert plain text or XML dictionaries into the Slob format, such as mw2slob and xdxf2slob."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"slob.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
