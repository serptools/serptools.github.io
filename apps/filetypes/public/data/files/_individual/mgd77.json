Today, it is used as an exchange format for geophysical data, which includes magnetics, bathymetry, gravity, and seismic navigation. MGD77 files are created from raw data collected by marine researchers studying underwater depth of lake and ocean floors. The data is stored in InfoBank, a structured information storage scheme of databases and software, and then exported in the MGD77 format to transmit data to and from a data center for analysis.","The MGD77T format is a new revision of the MGD77 format. It allows space savings, expanded field lengths, and easier import into other programs. This format uses the .M77T file extension."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mgd77.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
