They can also adjust their pattern's (and thus plushie's) size, and modify other pattern settings.","If a sewist wants to save a copy of their Plushify project (e.g., because they plan to re-use it in the future), they can do so by selecting the Save button found in Plushify's upper-right corner. This saves the project as a PLUSH file. Each PLUSH file consists of JSON-formatted plain text that describes the 3D model from which the sewist created their pattern, as well as the edits they've made in Plushify. Plushify uses this plain text data to load and display a sewist's 3D model and pattern."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/plush_13432.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .plush file in Plushify","caption":"PLUSH file open in Plushify"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"plush.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
