While the app is available on multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, and the web, only the Android version supports ATTHEME files. Users can save themes as ATTHEME files within the Telegram app using its built-in theme editor or download ATTHEME files from Telegram theme-sharing channels.","ATTHEME files contain a list of key-value pairs that define visual elements of the Telegram Android interface, such as color codes for backgrounds, message bubbles, text, icons, and other UI components.
