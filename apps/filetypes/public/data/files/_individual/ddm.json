So the more edits you make, the larger the DDM file will be.","For every table you create in Alpha Five, a DDM, DDD, and .DDX file will be created. These files make up the table data dictionary for a .DBF file. The dictionary stores queries, saved utility settings, and layouts. It's referenced by Alpha Five to overcome limitations of the DBF file. DDM files should be kept with the DDD and DDX Data Dictionary files in order for Alpha to find all of the elements and their pieces.","NOTE: In 2013, Alpha Five became Alpha Anywhere."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"[Name of your table].ddm","description":"[Name of your table].ddm - When a table is created, the DDM file will be created with the same name as your table."}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ddm.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
