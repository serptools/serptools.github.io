Many of the publisher's recent mobile games use TEXTS files to store in-game text in a binary format. Some games use KEYS files to \"read\" this text, while translating it to show in-game. Others use markers included in the TEXTS file itself.","NOTE: Games developed using a variety of Gameloft development engines use TEXTS files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"texts.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
