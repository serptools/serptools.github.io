The extension hides the file from being recognized as what it really is, like a .JPG file, and prevents other applications on the device from recognizing the file.","For example, KeepSafe may save an image file as 1543305784357378655.IMG_1549.JPG.HID2 . The \"1543305784357378655\" is a random string of numbers generated by KeepSafe and \"HID2\" is the extension added by the program.","NOTE: The HID2 extension was replaced by the .KSD extension in 2013."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"hid2.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
