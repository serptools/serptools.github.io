To create a LaTeX document, a writer uses a LaTeX or plain text editor to define the document's elements and content using the LaTeX markup language . A publisher can then use a TeX publication program to transform the LaTeX document into a formatted .PDF or other publishable document.","DataTex is a LaTeX document creation and management system created by Spyros Fronimos. It allows professors (and others) to create databases of course exercises, proofs, definitions, and other LaTeX documents. (Often, one database per course.) The LaTeX documents that DataTex creates are saved as DTEX files.","Each DTEX file is saved within a database ( .DB file), the path to which is specified in that DTEX file. A DTEX file can also include additional DataTex metadata, such as the document's:","In DataTex, users can use this additional metadata to sort and filter their DTEX documents, making it easier to retrieve specific documents."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/dtex_13499.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .dtex file in DataTex","caption":"DTEX file open in DataTex"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"dtex.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
