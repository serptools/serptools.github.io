AUP3 files are database files that store a project's included audio files, project settings, and metadata.","When a user creates or opens an AUP3 file, the Windows and Linux versions of Audacity create a corresponding AUP3-SHM file. This file is a temporary file that Audacity uses to store and write data to the user's AUP3 file. Audacity automatically deletes related AUP3-SHM files when a user closes an AUP3 file. The Mac version of Audacity does not create AUP3-SHM files.","NOTE: Audacity also creates .AUP3-WAL temporary files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"aup3-shm.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
