These features are helpful for people with disabilities and those looking to customize how they control specific aspects of their device (i.e., creating shortcuts to save time).","One of the accessibility features is Voice Control, which enables you to create custom commands the device runs when you speak to it. For example, you can speak commands to perform gestures, dictate and edit text, and interact with screen elements.","To access the Voice Control capabilities on your iOS device, tap Settings → Accessibility → Voice Control . Then, to create a voice control command, select Customize Commands → Custom → Create New Command . After making your command(s), you can export it (them) to a VOICECONTROLCOMMANDS file by selecting Export Custom Commands from the \"Customize Commands\" screen."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/voicecontrolcommands_13520.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .voicecontrolcommands file in Apple iOS Settings 16","caption":"VOICECONTROLCOMMANDS file open in Apple iOS Settings 16"},{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/voicecontrolcommands_13520-2.png","alt":"OBJ file open in Apple TextEdit","caption":"OBJ file open in Apple TextEdit"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"voicecontrolcommands.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
