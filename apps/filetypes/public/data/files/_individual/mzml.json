PSI created this XML-based format to replace two previous, competing mass spectrometer output formats: mzData (developed by PSI) and mzXML (developed by the Seattle Proteome Center). The mzML format incorporates and combines the best features of both mzData and mzXML.","Now, several mass spectrometry applications can save mass spectrometer output data in the mzML format and open MZML files. Thus, analytical chemists and biochemists who plan to share their mass spectrometer output data often save that data in the mzML format.","NOTE: In addition to ion mass-to-charge ratio and intensity data, MZML files can contain metadata about the settings and conditions under which this output data was captured."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mzml.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
