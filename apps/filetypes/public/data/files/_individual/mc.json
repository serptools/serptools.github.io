  "summary": "An MC file is a 3D model created by Molecular Constructor, a free molecule building program. It is a plain text file that specifies atoms' positions and bonds within a molecule and, when loaded in Molecular Constructor, is used to show the molecule in 3D. Currently, MC files are created and used by only the mobile versions of Molecular Constructor. However, the program's developers say the desktop version of Molecular Constructor will soon support MC files.",
