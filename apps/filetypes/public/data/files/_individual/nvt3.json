Typically, users watch these videos from within their NetVue camera's associated app (connected to the camera via a network).","In some cases, however, users may wish to retrieve and play videos directly from their camera's SD card. Or, users who do not have access to NetVue's camera app may wish to play an NVT3 file they've been given. For this purpose, NetVue created standalone NVT Player applications for Windows and macOS, which can play NVT3 videos."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"nvt3.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
