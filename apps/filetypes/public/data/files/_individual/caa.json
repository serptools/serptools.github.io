The files are very small in size since they only contain a short string of text. The size allows users to more easily share links to large journal downloads.","When a CAA file is double-clicked it is opened by CNKI CAJViewer, which begins the downloading of the journal. Once the download begins, a control window opens that displays the name of the journal being downloaded, the file size, and the download rate.","NOTE: CNKI stands for China National Knowledge Infrastructure."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"caa.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
