Using the Eos family software, lighting designers can design, save, and run theater lighting sequences, referred to as shows.","Version 2.9 of Eos saves designers' shows in the compressed ESF2 format by default. (Optionally, designers can instead save their shows in the ESF format.) While ESF2 and ESF files contain the same data, ESF2 files are compressed (to reduce their file size). Due to this difference between the ESF2 and ESF formats, versions 2.8.3 and below of Eos cannot open ESF2 files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"esf2.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
