If the user decides to restore the trashed file, Trash uses the associated TRASHINFO file to determine where the trashed file should be restored to.","As such, if you delete a trashed file's associated TRASHINFO file, your Trash application will not be able to restore the trashed file. Linux TRASHINFO files are typically stored in the ~/Trash/info directory."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"trashinfo.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
