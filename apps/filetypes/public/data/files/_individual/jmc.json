JM-Crypt also uses the \".jmcx\", \".jmck\", \".jmcp\", \".jmcr\", and \".jmce\" file extensions for encrypting files.","The JM-Crypt algorithm uses the one-time pad (OTP) encryption method and twice encrypts the file. The first encryption is with a random extract of a long random key generated by JM-Crypt Security's homemade fast Fourier transform (FFT) key generator. The second encryption includes password protection that depends on the method selected by the user, which may be fully automatic, semi-automatic (project mode), or manual (a password created by the user and featured in the JMC file), and includes password protection.","NOTE: In order to decrypt the JMC file, you need the JM-Crypt software and algorithm that were used to originally encrypt the file."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"jmc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
