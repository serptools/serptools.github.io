{"slug":"fb!","extension":"fb!","name":"FlashGet Incomplete Download File","category":"flashget-incomplete-download-file","summary":"","developer_org":"flashget","developer_name":"FlashGet","more_information":{"description":["FlashGet automatically appends the \".fb!\" extension to a file that is being downloaded. For example, if you are downloading a .AVI file, the software saves the file with the compound \".avi.fb!\" extension. When the download is complete, FlashGet removes the \".fb!\" extension. This convention is also used in other download manager applications, such as BitTorrent ( .!BT files) and BitComet ( .BC! files).","NOTE: Even if a download is incomplete, sometimes you can view the contents of the file manually by removing the \".fb!\" extension and opening the file. However, results will vary because the file does not contain the complete data."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"fb!.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
