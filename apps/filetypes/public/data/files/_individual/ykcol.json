It is commonly referred to as ransomware, where the purpose of the virus is to take your files hostage and force you to pay the perpetrator (typically by way of bitcoin) to unlock your files.","The virus is commonly introduced through spam emails titled \"Status of invoice\" with a .7Z attachment, which is a .VBS file compressed with 7-Zip compression. If you download the 7Z file and decompress it, the VBS file is run and the virus begins scrambling your files, renaming them with the \".ykcol\" extension, and encrypting them. The virus then generates a .BMP ( ykcol.bmp ) or .HTM ( ykcol.htm ) ransom note informing you of the takeover and what you need to do to recover your files.","NOTE: YKCOL is LOCKY backwards."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ykcol.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
