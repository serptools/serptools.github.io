EZ Flash allows General Motors vehicle owners to overwrite their vehicles' default settings, using modified settings stored in TRTX files.","Each TRTX file is designed for use with a specific model of General Motors automobile (named in the file's filename). When a user purchases EZ Flash, TRIFECTA asks the user to specify the vehicle(s) with which they plan to use the program, as well as the vehicle settings they'd like to modify. Then, TRIFECTA provides the user with the appropriate TRTX files, which they can load, modify, and send to their vehicle via EZ Flash."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"trtx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
