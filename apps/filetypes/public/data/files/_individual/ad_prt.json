To create assemblies, engineers combine various parts, which represent mechanical or sheet metal components.","Engineers can design parts themselves using Alibre Design's part design tools or import parts from outside the program. These parts are saved as AD_PRT files.","NOTE: Alibre Design also allows users to import parts saved in the STEP, .STP , .IGS , .PAR , .SLDPRT , and .IPT formats, among others. When a user saves one of these parts, they can choose to convert it to the AD_PRT format. Users must convert some imported parts to the AD_PRT format before they can include them in assemblies."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ad_prt.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
