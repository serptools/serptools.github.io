Once compiled without errors, they add their script to a compatible gaming controller adapter, such as a Cronus Zen or Titan 2 device, and connect it to their controller, such as a PlayStation or Xbox controller, via Bluetooth or a port . The gaming controller adapter acts as a bridge, translating the input signals (defined in the GPC script) from the controller into a format that the connected system (e.g., a gaming console or computer) understands.","NOTE: The CronusMAX and Titan device teams developed the GPC language specifically for use with their gaming controller adapters and software platforms. These teams are part of Collective Minds, a company specializing in gaming peripherals and customization tools."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/gpc_13775.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .gpc file in Collective Minds Zen Studio 1.6","caption":"GPC file open in Collective Minds Zen Studio 1.6"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"gpc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
