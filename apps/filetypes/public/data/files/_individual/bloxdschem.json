It provides various types of gameplay, including parkour, tag, and build modes. When building, players can construct structures using blocks, and save their progress as BLOXDSCHEM files.","Specifically, BLOXDSCHEM files contain a detailed blueprint of the block arrangement for a specific structure or object, including the types, positions, and orientations of the blocks and specifications for block colors, textures, or materials used in the structure, ensuring Bloxd.io accurately renders the world when loading it. The files also store metadata, such as the build name, creator, and version compatibility with Bloxd.io."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/bloxdschem_13777.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .bloxdschem file in Bloxd.io","caption":"BLOXDSCHEM file open in Bloxd.io"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"bloxdschem.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
