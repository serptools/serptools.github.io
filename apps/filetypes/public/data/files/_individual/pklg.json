Optionally, developers can install a package of add-on tools that Apple makes available for Xcode. One of these tools is Apple PacketLogger.","PacketLogger allows developers to log the Bluetooth traffic between an iOS or macOS device and other devices. (Before logging traffic, developers must install a logging profile on their iOS or macOS device.) Primarily, developers use PacketLogger to examine Bluetooth-enabled apps' Bluetooth activity and debug any problems they find. PacketLogger records a decoded version of each data packet sent, as well as metadata about each packet.","After recording information in PacketLogger, developers can save that log as a PKLG file. Doing so allows the developer to retain a copy of the traffic log they recorded, to share with others or review again at a later time."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"Bluetooth.pklg","description":"Bluetooth.pklg - The default name PacketLogger assigns to PKLG files."}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"pklg.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
