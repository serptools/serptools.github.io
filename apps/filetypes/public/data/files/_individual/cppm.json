Modules were designed to reduce dependency issues, improve code organization, and enhance compilation speed. They provide a modern alternative to older practices like header files ( .H ) and implementation files ( .CPP ), offering a more efficient way to manage code in reusable, self-contained units, though they can also work alongside traditional methods.","Developers use CPPM files to make their projects more maintainable and scalable, especially in large projects with complex dependencies in fields like system software, game development, and scientific computing. When ready to build, developers can compile CPPM files with C++ compilers that support the C++20 standard, such as GNU Compiler Collection or Clang (included with LLVM)."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/cppm_13766.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .cppm file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code 1.9","caption":"CPPM file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code 1.9"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"cppm.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
