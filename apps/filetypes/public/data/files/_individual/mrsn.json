For example, comments are preceded by hashtags (#) in both languages. However, methods and variables are stated explicitly in Mersenne (preceded by \"method\" or \"var\"), whereas this is not necessary in Python. Mersenne is open source and extensible, allowing developers to implement other languages, such as Java or C++, in Mersenne programs to increase functionality.","NOTE: If you have MersenneX installed on your machine, you can run MRSN files simply by double-clicking them. You can also convert MRSN files into MRSNP Mersenne programs with Perfector, which comes packaged with MersenneX."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/mrsn_11092.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .mrsn file in File Viewer","caption":"MRSN file open in File Viewer"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mrsn.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
