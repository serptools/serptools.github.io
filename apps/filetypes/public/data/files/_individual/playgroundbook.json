{"slug":"playgroundbook","extension":"playgroundbook","name":"Swift Playgrounds Lesson Book","category":"swift-playgrounds-lesson-book","summary":"","developer_org":"apple","developer_name":"Apple","more_information":{"description":["Swift Playgrounds is an iPad and Mac app that teaches novice developers how to code with Swift, a programming language used to create apps for Apple devices. Teachers and other experienced developers who want to create new Swift Playgrounds lesson books can do using Apple Xcode and the Swift Playgrounds Author Template. After filling in the template with their lesson and related Swift code, developers must save their lesson book as a PLAYGROUNDBOOK file.","Only the iPad version of Swift Playgrounds uses PLAYGROUNDBOOK files. The Mac version of Swift Playgrounds cannot open them. To share a PLAYGROUNDBOOK file with an iPad user, Mac users typically either AirDrop the file or share it from a cloud storage service. When a Playgrounds user opens a PLAYGROUNDBOOK file, it appears as a lesson book, complete with interactive lessons and a live code previewer."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"playgroundbook.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
