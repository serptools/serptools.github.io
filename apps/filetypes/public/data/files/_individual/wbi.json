The WBI file is the same as an .ISO file except it is compact, which means it removes all the \"junk data\" used to pad Wii games to make them appear as full discs. WBI files may also be encrypted and password protected or digitally signed for software distribution.","NOTE: CISO files are more commonly seen with the .CISO file extension."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"wbi.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
