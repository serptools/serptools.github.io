Fusion Tables users created pie charts, bar charts, lineplots, timelines, and geographical maps, which they then shared with others.","Google Fusion Tables users who also used the desktop Google Drive or Backup and Sync from Google apps may have encountered GTABLE files. These files were shortcuts that allowed users to quickly open fusion tables in Google Fusion Tables. GTABLE files were JSON files that contained a fusion table's URL and document ID, as well as the name of the Gmail account used to create the fusion table.","In late 2019, Google announced it was discontinuing Google Fusion Tables and the Fusion Tables API. In March 2020, Google deleted all Fusion Tables data. As a result, most users' GTABLE files (which were stored in Google Drive) were also deleted. Any remaining GTABLE files can no longer open the fusion tables they were previously associated with, as those tables no longer exist."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"gtable.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
