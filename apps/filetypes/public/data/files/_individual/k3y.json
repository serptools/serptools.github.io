{"slug":"k3y","extension":"k3y","name":"USB Raptor Password File","category":"usb-raptor-password-file","summary":"","developer_org":"limbo666","developer_name":"limbo666","more_information":{"description":["USB Raptor is a utility that PC users can use to lock and unlock their computers using a USB drive, in addition to or instead of a system password. The USB drive that a user uses with USB Raptor must contain a specific K3Y file, which is a password file that USB Raptor searches for and reads to unlock the user's computer. If USB Raptor cannot find a user's K3Y file (for example, because the user removed their USB drive from their computer), it locks the user's computer.","Users create K3Y files by selecting USB Raptor's Unlock file settings tab and clicking the Create k3y file button. Users can also link USB Raptor to a specific USB drive using that USB drive's serial number. If they do, USB Raptor searches for both the specific USB drive and the user's K3Y file."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"k3y.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
