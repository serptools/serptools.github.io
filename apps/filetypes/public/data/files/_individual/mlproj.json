Researchers, developers, and engineers use MATLAB to perform calculations, develop algorithms, and model, analyze, and explore mathematical data.","When a MATLAB user wants to share a project ( .PRJ file) they've been working on with another user, they can package that project and all its component files (including referenced projects) as an MLPROJ file. MLPROJ files are compressed archives, which make them easy to email, upload to a cloud storage system, or store on a USB flash drive. Other MATLAB users can then access and decompress the MLPROJ file, to open the project it contains.","Sometimes, MLPROJ files may contain only some of the files used by a MATLAB project. Users can use MATLAB export profiles to choose what files they include in their MLPROJ archives."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/mlproj_11806.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .mlproj file in Apple Create ML","caption":"MLPROJ file open in Apple Create ML"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mlproj.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
