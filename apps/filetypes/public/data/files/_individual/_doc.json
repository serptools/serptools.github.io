For example, the email program changes sample..doc to sample._doc . This also commonly occurs with .DOCX , .XLS , and .XLSX files.","You can rename _DOC files by changing the \"._doc\" extension to \".doc\". After renaming the file, you can open it as a standard DOC file. Some programs that can open DOC files are Microsoft Word, Corel WordPerfect, LibreOffice Writer, and Apple Pages."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"_doc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
