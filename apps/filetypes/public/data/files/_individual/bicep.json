Instead of writing long and complex .JSON files, developers can more efficiently describe the same resources in a BICEP file.","BICEP files are particularly helpful for teams using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices, enabling version control and consistency across deployments. Once created, a BICEP file can be automatically compiled into an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template to automate deployment and configuration. The template can then be deployed using tools like Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/bicep_13771.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .bicep file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code 1.9","caption":"BICEP file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code 1.9"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"bicep.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
