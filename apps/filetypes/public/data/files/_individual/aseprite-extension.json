Aseprite's documentation refers to these plug-ins as extensions. Each Aseprite extension is saved as an ASEPRITE-EXTENSION file.","ASEPRITE-EXTENSION files are ZIP files that have been renamed to use the .aseprite-extension extension, so Aseprite can recognize and load them more easily. The files' contents differ based on the type of feature they are used to install. For example, an ASEPRITE-EXTENSION file used to install an additional language will contain a .JSON and .INI file, while an ASEPRITE-EXTENSION file used to install a new theme will contain a JSON, .XML , .PNG , and ASEPRITE-DATA file."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/aseprite-extension_12609.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .aseprite-extension file in Aseprite 1.2","caption":"ASEPRITE-EXTENSION file open in Aseprite 1.2"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"aseprite-extension.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
