In addition to FTP and SFTP, it also supports WebDAV and cloud storage services, such as Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, and Backblaze B2.","To enable Cyberduck to download files over 100 MB faster (as CYBERDUCKSEGMENT files), you must enable the \"Segmented downloads with multiple connections per file\" preference. Instructions for doing so:","After enabling the preference, Cyberduck downloads files larger than 100 MB as single CYBERDUCKSEGMENT archives that store multiple, numbered files with .cyberducksegment file extensions. For example, if you download an .EXE file named example.exe , the CYBERDUCKSEGMENT archive name will be example.exe.cyberducksegment and it will contain multiple, numbered CYBERDUCKSEGMENT files (e.g., 1.cyberducksegment , 2.cyberducksegment , and so on)."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/cyberducksegment_13644.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .cyberducksegment file in Apple Finder 13","caption":"CYBERDUCKSEGMENT file open in Apple Finder 13"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"cyberducksegment.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
