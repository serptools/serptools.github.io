It is very similar to the Bash shell. As zsh has become more popular (including being used as macOS's default Terminal shell), users have sought to extend the shell's functionality. The Oh My Zsh library allows zsh users to install useful zsh plug-ins and change their shell's appearance using custom themes.","Oh My Zsh's custom themes are stored in ZSH-THEME files. These files are shell scripts, similar to .SH files, that users can execute by setting their .zshrc file's ZSH_THEME setting to the name of a ZSH-THEME file. Executing the script changes zsh's appearance. While Oh My Zsh includes over 100 custom themes, zsh users can also create and apply their own custom themes. To be used with zsh, ZSH-THEME files must be stored in Oh My Zsh's themes directory."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"zsh-theme.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
