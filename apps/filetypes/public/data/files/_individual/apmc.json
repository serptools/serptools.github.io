In these games, items needed to progress through the game are randomized and placed throughout multiple players' game worlds. To progress, players must work together to find the items placed in their worlds.","Minecraft Java Edition players can use Archipelago to create and play multiworld games. To do so, they create .YAML files that specify their desired game world settings. Then, they provide the YAML files to the multiworld game host, who uses the files to create a set of APMC files (from Archipelago's Generate Game screen).","Each APMC file contains a seed that a player can use to connect to their specific game world, via Minecraft Forge. As long as the corresponding multiworld game room is active in Archipelago, Minecraft Java Edition players can double-click an APMC file to play in the world to which it is linked."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/apmc_13465.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .apmc file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"APMC file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"apmc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
