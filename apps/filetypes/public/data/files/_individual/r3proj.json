However, it was re-released on Steam in 2015 with an official English translation of the game.","The R3PROJ file is the main file type associated with RPG Maker 2003. When users begin developing a game in the program, they create and save their projects in the R3PROJ files by default. The files are meant to only be opened with RPG Maker 2003. Once users are finished developing their game they can compile the project as an .EXE file to distribute it with its resources for other users to play.","RPG Maker superseded RPG Maker 2000, and then was superseded by RPG Maker XP in 2005. Some other versions include RPG Maker VX Ace (released in 2011), which saves projects as .RVPROJ2 files and RPG Maker MV (released in 2015), which saves projects as .RPGPROJECT files.","NOTE: RPG Maker 2003 is developed by Kadokawa Games. It was originally published by Enterbrain, but is published on Steam by Degica Games."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"r3proj.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
