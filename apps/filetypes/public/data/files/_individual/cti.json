The games have an enthusiastic modding community, which enjoys modifying various aspects of the simulators' gameplay by editing their configuration files.","CTI files are OMSI configuration files that list one or more paint jobs, or repaints, that can be applied to buses in-game. Each listed repaint starts with the [item] tag, followed by the repaint's name (shown in the Bus select menu), color scheme, and associated texture file (usually a .DDS , .TGA , , or .PNG file). Modders often edit these files to add additional, custom repaints that they can then select in-game."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"cti.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
