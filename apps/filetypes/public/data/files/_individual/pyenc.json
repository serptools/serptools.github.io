FileEncrypt.py is used to encrypt files, such as documents, images, or videos, using the AES-256 encryption algorithm. To encrypt a file, a user runs FileEncrypt.py , enters a filename, and enters a password. The entered file is then encrypted and saved as a PYENC file.","To decrypt a PYENC file, users run FileDecrypt.py and enter their PYENC file's filename. They then enter the password used to encrypt the file. FileDecrypt.py then decrypts the file, allowing the user to open it as they would normally."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"pyenc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
