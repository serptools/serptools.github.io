However, sometimes a file named default.pbxuser is checked into the repository at the outset of the project so that all developers start with the same common preferences instead of having to redefine them each individually.","NOTE: The PBXUSER file for an Xcode project is stored within the .XCODEPROJ project file. To access this file manually, remove the \".xcodeproj\" extension from the XCODEPROJ file and open the resulting folder."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"pbxuser.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
