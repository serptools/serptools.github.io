They are like reading through a book, but you can play through the narrative by controlling characters with text commands and interacting with the environment in the story. Inform is a free application that provides tools for creating and sharing custom IF stories that other users can experience.","You can define your playable IF program in an NI source code file. Then, you can compile it with Inform 7 into a playable file, such as a .GBLORB or .ZBLORB file.","You can create an NI file with any text editor. When you save the file, save it with the .ni file extension. You may need to instead save the file as a .TXT file, then manually change the .txt file extension to .ni .","NOTE: NI source code files were introduced with the release of Inform 7, replacing .INF source code files. The files may also be saved as the less common I7 files."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/ni_11776.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .ni file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code 1.51","caption":"NI file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code 1.51"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ni.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
