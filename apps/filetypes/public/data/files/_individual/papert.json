While PAPERT templates store contents in the same format as PAPER documents, Paper users create and share the templates to preserve the formatting and content of a document they wish to replicate. Users can create a PAPERT template from a PAPER document by opening the document, clicking the â€¦ (ellipses) icon, and selecting Templatize .","Like PAPER files, Paper only uses PAPERT files internally, meaning you cannot download PAPERT files from the online workspace. However, you can share a link to download a .URL shortcut to the PAPERT file, which you can double-click to open in the Paper workspace. The file will appear with an underscore preceding the template name followed by the .papert.url extension (e.g., _template.papert.url )."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/papert_13763.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .papert file in Dropbox Paper","caption":"PAPERT file open in Dropbox Paper"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"papert.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
