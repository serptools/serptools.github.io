During their hike, players can use A Short Hike's Save & Quit option to save their in-progress game. When they do, the game creates a MOUNTAIN file, which contains a record of the user's current hike.","A Short Hike does not have multiple save slots, so it only ever creates and reads one MOUNTAIN file. If you want to start a new game of A Short Hike but do not want to overwrite your current saved game, you can rename your current GameSaveNew.mountain file to any other filename. Then, when you start your new game, A Short Hike will create a new GameSaveNew.mountain file, instead of overwriting your previous file. Then, you can resume either game by switching the MOUNTAIN files' names as needed.","NOTE: A Short Hike also sometimes creates MOUNTAIN_BACKUP files, which are backups of players' saved game."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mountain.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
