It comes with associated software that, among other things, allows users to access the Stream Deck Store.","From the Stream Deck Store, users can download sound effects and music saved as STREAMDECKAUDIO files. These files are .WAV files that have been modified slightly, such that they work with only the Stream Deck. Thus, you cannot play STREAMDECKAUDIO files in media players (unless you convert them to normal WAV files, as described below)."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/streamdeckaudio_13344.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .streamdeckaudio file in Elgato Stream Deck","caption":"STREAMDECKAUDIO file open in Elgato Stream Deck"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"streamdeckaudio.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
