RawTherapee users can also share the files with other users, allowing them to apply the same processing style to their photos.","When users edit a photo with RawTherapee, the software automatically creates a PP3 file to save their changes. This file is typically stored alongside the original image and uses the same filename but with the .pp3 extension applied. For example, a PP3 file for the example.CR3 image is named example.CR3.pp3 . Additionally, users can open the image in RawTherapee later, and the program will automatically load the settings from the PP3 file so they can continue editing or export the image with their previous adjustments.","NOTE: PP3 files are similar to .SIDECAR and .NKSC sidecar files used by Blackmagic and Nikon."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/pp3_13818.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .pp3 file in RawTherapee 5","caption":"PP3 file open in RawTherapee 5"},{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/pp3_13818-2.png","alt":"PP3 file open in Microsoft Notepad","caption":"PP3 file open in Microsoft Notepad"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"pp3.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
