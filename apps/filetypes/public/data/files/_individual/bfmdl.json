In most cases, BFMDL files are stored within BFRES files, alongside textures, animations, and other data meant to be used with that model. This allows a game to efficiently load the model and related data from one archive (rather than separate locations).","However, in rare cases, Wii U enthusiasts may encounter BFMDL files saved as separate files. The models these files contain are saved in the same format as the models that BFRES files contain.","NOTE: Switch-Toolbox, a Nintendo file modding toolkit, can export Wii U models as BFMDL files (even if the model was originally saved within a BFRES file)."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"bfmdl.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
