You can change the settings for a specific file type, so when you open that file the settings will change accordingly. Some of the preferences they can change are the line padding, scrolling behavior, text color theme, and whether automatic indentation is enabled.","You can manually change preference settings using the Preferences.sublime-setttings file. There is a default and user version of the file, one is located in the Packages/​Default directory and the other is located in the Packages/​User directory. Be sure to edit the Preferences.sublime-settings file in the Packages/​User directory instead of the Packages/​Default directory. This prevents your customizations from being overwritten when a new version of Sublime Text is installed. You can also access these files through Preferences → Settings - Default or Preferences → Settings - User .","NOTE: In version 2 of Sublime Text, the SUBLIME-SETTINGS file replaced the .SUBLIME-OPTIONS file, which was used in version 1."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"sublime-settings.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
