Blender, an open source 3D modeling tool, provides OgreXML export and therefore is a common tool for creating JME scenes. After an OgreXML scene is imported, you can right-click the model and choose \"Convert to JME binary\" to convert the model into the J3O format.","NOTE: You can preview J3O files with SceneViewer, a program included with the jMonkeyEngine SDK."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"j3o.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
