Nonograms are puzzles that originated in Japan in the 1980s. They contain cells in a grid with numbers on the sides to indicate which cells should be colored in or left blank. The user must solve the number pattern, then fill in the cells with the appropriate coloring. Once the coloring is complete, the puzzle reveals a hidden picture to the user.","The NON file is one of many nonogram puzzle file types used by various nonogram puzzle programs. The format was created by Dr. Steven Simpson, a Senior Research Associate at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom.","NOTE: A NON file can store information about only one puzzle. Files that store multiple nonogram puzzles are given the .nonpack extension."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"non.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
