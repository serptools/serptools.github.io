It is similar to Sound Forge Pro software but provides fewer capabilities.","As you edit a project with Sound Forge Audio Studio, you can save your progress as an SFAS file to preserve your modifications, effects, and settings. Saving the project allows you to close and reopen the SFAS project file to edit it without losing your work.","NOTE: SFAS files do not store multimedia imported into a project to prevent them from becoming large. Instead, the project references the imported files in a folder that bears the same name as the SFAS project."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/sfas_13613.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .sfas file in MAGIX Sound Forge Audio Studio 17","caption":"SFAS file open in MAGIX Sound Forge Audio Studio 17"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"sfas.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
