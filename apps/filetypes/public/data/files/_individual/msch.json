While constructing their factories, players can select all or part of a structure they've built and save that selection as a schematic. Doing so allows the player to quickly place copies of the selection (in their current game) and to export the selection as an MSCH file (for use in other games).","To save a structure as an MSCH file:","After creating your MSCH file, you can select Export to export it for use in other Mindustry games.
