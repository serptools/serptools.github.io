It's especially helpful for users who have to repeatedly type the same phrases, sentences, and URL addresses. Users can add to these set files by creating abbreviations, for e.g., \"Thanks\" can be added for the sentence \"Thank you for your time.\" It's also used as an AutoCorrection tool for misspellings, for e.g., \"poeple\" becomes \"people.\" Typinator is not limited to text either, it can be used to insert pictures through typing shortcuts.","NOTE: The TYIMPORT file is the imported version of .TYSET ."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"tyimport.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
