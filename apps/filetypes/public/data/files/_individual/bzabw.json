AbiSource only actively develops the Linux version (since version 3) of AbiWord, while older versions of the application are also available for Windows and macOS.","Since ABW documents store information in the XML standard, they may grow large. To reduce the size of an ABW document, AbiWord allows you to compress it with Bzip2 compression.","NOTE: Various versions of AbiWord may also compress ABW files with gzip compression, resulting in a .ZABW file."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"bzabw.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
