Motion sensor via USB and point the sensor at a moving object, such as a ball, cart, or ramp, to track the object's movement, velocity, and acceleration. As Graphical Analysis collects the data captured by the sensor, you can share and analyze the data in real time. You can then save the data as a GAMBL project by selecting Save from the file menu."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/gambl_13744.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .gambl file in Vernier Graphical Analysis 6","caption":"GAMBL file open in Vernier Graphical Analysis 6"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"gambl.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
