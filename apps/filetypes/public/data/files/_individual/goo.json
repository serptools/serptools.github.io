These users typically craft high-resolution models for applications such as miniatures, prototypes, or functional parts. The format is prevalent among users of ELEGOO resin printers like the Saturn 3 Ultra and Jupiter SE .","Users generate GOO files with slicer software compatible with ELEGOO printers, most notably SatelLite. For example, the software imports a 3D model file (e.g., .STL or .OBJ ) and slices it into layers, converting it into the GOO format with all necessary printing parameters. Users can then customize settings before exporting the file in GOO format."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/goo_13780.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .goo file in ELEGOO SatelLite 1","caption":"GOO file open in ELEGOO SatelLite 1"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"goo.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
