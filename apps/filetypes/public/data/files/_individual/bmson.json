Each BMS song is saved as a directory that contains a plain text BMS file and several audio files (often .WAV or .OGG files). The BMS file defines the song's music, note positions, sound effects (such as the sounds played when a player succeeds or fails at hitting a note), and other information.","To make creating, editing, and loading BMS songs easier, various rhythm game enthusiasts collaborated to create the BMSON format. BMSON files serve the same function as and are similar to BMS files, except that they use JSON formatting. Formatting data using JSON, rather than an arbitrary standard, makes it easier for song creators and rhythm game developers to parse the data that BMSON files contain."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"bmson.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
