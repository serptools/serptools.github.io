Many of the effects and assets that users can add to their videos are saved as XYT files.","Each XYT file is an XML file that contains additional binary data. All XYT files contain a binary file header, and many XYT files contain binary data that describes their included effect or asset.","In some cases, XYT files are instead linked with an associated asset. For example, XYT files used to add music to a video are linked with an associated .M4A audio file.","NOTE: VivaVideo Lite and other QuVideo video editing apps also use effects saved as XYT files."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/xyt_13438.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .xyt file in Apple TextEdit","caption":"XYT file open in Apple TextEdit"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"xyt.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
