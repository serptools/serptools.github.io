Apps created using Baidu's SDK often share users' information without their permission. One of the ways these apps do this is by copying sensitive information, which requires permission to access, to unrestricted folders. That way, other apps can access the sensitive information from the unrestricted folders, without asking your permission.","For example, some apps that use the Baidu SDK create hidden CUID2 files in your SD card's backups/â€‹.SystemConfig directory. Other apps can then access these CUID2 files and use them to learn your device's ID and IMEI without your permission.","NOTE: Apps that use the Baidu SDK also often create .CUID files on users' devices."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"cuid2.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
