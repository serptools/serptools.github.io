After the ransomware finishes encrypting a user's files, it produces plain text ransom notes named _DECODE_FILES.txt . These notes contain instructions a user is supposed to follow to pay a ransom and decrypt their files. (FileInfo recommends you never pay a ransom to decrypt your files.)","Files encrypted by UIWIX ransomware are appended with a series of random numbers and the .uiwix extension. For example, a file named filename.jpg may become filename.jpg._2237325398.uiwix after encryption."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"uiwix.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
