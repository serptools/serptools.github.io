As the game progresses toward the year 1453, players must earn prestige and continue their dynasty for as long as possible.","When Crusader Kings III saves a player's current game, it stores the saved game data in a CK3 file. If a player manually saves their progress, Crusader Kings III creates a Zip-compressed CK3 file. This archive contains a compressed plain text record of the player's game state. When Crusader Kings III autosaves a player's progress, the resulting CK3 file is saved as an uncompressed plain text file.","Plain text CK3 files, and the plain text gamestate files that compressed CK3 files contain, are comprised of several sections of editable saved game data and metadata.
