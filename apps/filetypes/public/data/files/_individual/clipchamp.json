It is a video editing application used by content creators, educators, businesses, and casual users looking to create social media videos, presentations, and marketing content.","The software is available for Windows and as an online tool in personal and work versions. While each version saves projects as CLIPCHAMP files, only the Work version allows users to share CLIPCHAMP files for collaborative editing by selecting the Share button in the upper-right corner of the program. Users can then choose recipients to invite to modify the project via OneDrive or SharePoint (recipients can click the link to download the CLIPCHAMP project and open it with Clipchamp)."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/clipchamp_13791.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .clipchamp file in Microsoft Clipchamp 3","caption":"CLIPCHAMP file open in Microsoft Clipchamp 3"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"clipchamp.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
