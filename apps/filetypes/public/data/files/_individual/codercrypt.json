The criminals listed the app as Cyberpunk 2077 Mobile (BETA) and designed the website to appear similar to the Google Play store.","The site was not affiliated with Google or the actual developers of Cyberpunk 2077 , but many unsuspecting users did not notice and downloaded the app to their Android devices. Once they granted the fake app permission to access their files and completed the installation, the ransomware stored within the app ran, encrypting their files and appending them with the .coderCrypt extension.","When CoderWare ransomware, also known as Cyberpunk 2077 mobile ransomware, runs, it infects your Android device and encrypts your files with the RC4 encryption algorithm. After encrypting the files, the ransomware appends the .coderCrypt extension to their filenames. For example, an example.png file becomes example.png.coderCrypt .","After encrypting your files, the ransomware displays a README.txt message detailing the hostile takeover and includes instructions for how you can access your files via payment. FileInfo recommends you never pay a ransom to decrypt your files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"codercrypt.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
