Users can save the computations as Wolfram Language Packs (WL files) and organize them within Mathematica Notebook ( .NB ) files to create data analysis visualizations and other outputs.","Mathematica automatically loads default WL files when a user runs the software to allow users to access the inputs. Users can also load other WL files included with the app to access their inputs or create their WL files with Mathematica or the Wolfram Workbench IDE, then load those files in Mathematica.","NOTE: WL files are the same as the M files they replaced but bear the .wl file extension to set them apart from other file types that use the .m extension."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/wl_13687.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .wl file in Wolfram Research Mathematica 14","caption":"WL file open in Wolfram Research Mathematica 14"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"wl.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
