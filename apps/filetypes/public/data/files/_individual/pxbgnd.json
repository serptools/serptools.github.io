For example, a user working on tile-based artwork can set a checkerboard pattern as the background to distinguish transparent areas easily, then save that setup as a PXBGND file for reuse. These files help streamline the editing process by allowing artists to quickly switch between different visual backgrounds tailored to specific tasks or preferences.","To create a PXBGND file with the Pro version of Pixen, select Window â†’ Backgrounds Library , click the + button, and select a starting template from Flat, Checkerboard, Slashed, or Image types. You can then customize the backgrounds."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/pxbgnd_13844.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .pxbgnd file in Furnace Creek Software Pixen 5","caption":"PXBGND file open in Furnace Creek Software Pixen 5"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"pxbgnd.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
