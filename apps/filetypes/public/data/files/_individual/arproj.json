For example, a Spark AR Studio user could create a \"flaming aura\" effect and then apply the effect to the people, animals, or items featured in a video.","When a user saves a Spark AR Studio effects project, the program creates a new project directory. This directory contains an ARPROJ file and any assets the user has imported into their project. The ARPROJ file is a record of the edits the user has made to their project. It is the file Spark AR Studio uses to load and display the project.","After a user has finished editing their project in Spark AR Studio, they can export the project as an .AREXPORT file to upload it to Spark AR Hub, the platform from which users access their Spark AR effects. They can also package the project and its included assets as an .ARPROJPKG file, using the File â†’ Package... option."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"arproj.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
