It allows developers to create 2D video games, using drag-and-drop programming and the GameMaker scripting language. Developers can then publish their finalized games for play on a variety of platforms.","Typically, GameMaker Studio projects are saved as a directory that contains a YYP file (which defines the project's layout and included assets) and several sub-directories (which contain the project's assets, objects, and other data). However, developers can also export a GameMaker Studio project as a single YYZ file. This Zip-compressed file contains all the project's data, packaged into a single archive for easier storage and sharing.","To export a GameMaker project as a YYZ file: Open the project in GameMaker. Select File → Export Project → YYZ . Name and save your YYZ file. NOTE: In version 2.3, GameMaker began saving YYZ files in an updated format. Thus, YYZ files created by versions 2.3 and above of GameMaker cannot be opened in versions 2.2 and below.","NOTE: In version 2.3, GameMaker began saving YYZ files in an updated format.
