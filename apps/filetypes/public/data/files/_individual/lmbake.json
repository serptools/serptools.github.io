Each game is comprised of a series of scenes, which are themselves comprised of a series of nodes representing different in-game elements.","One of the nodes developers can add to a Godot Engine scene is BakedLightmap. The BakedLightmap node allows developers to add indirect and direct lighting to a scene. Developers then \"bake\" their scene's lighting, compiling it for use in their scene. If a developer is saving their scene as a text-based TSCN file, Godot Engine will compile the developer's lighting in a separate LMBAKE file. This avoids bloating the developer's TSCN file with encoded, binary data."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"lmbake.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
