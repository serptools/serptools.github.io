{"slug":"pskx","extension":"pskx","name":"Unreal Engine Static Mesh","category":"unreal-engine-static-mesh","summary":"","developer_org":"epic-games","developer_name":"Epic Games","more_information":{"description":["The Unreal Engine is a video game development engine that has been used to create many popular video games, including Unreal Tournament, Gears of War, and Mass Effect. Unreal Engine Resource Viewer, also known as Unreal Model Viewer and UModel, is a tool that game modders and developers can use to view and extract resources from Unreal Engine games.","When a UModel user extracts a static mesh, UModel saves that mesh as a PSKX file. PSKX files are similar to .PSK files, except they don't contain skeletons and thus can't be animated. Most often, the PSKX files contain a shape used to add a static environmental feature to a video game level.","NOTE: In versions 3 and below of Unreal Engine, users could change a PSKX file's extension to .psk and import it for use as a static mesh. However, versions 4 and above of Unreal Engine can only import .FBX meshes. Thus, to import a PSKX file into versions 4 and above of Unreal Engine, you must convert it to an FBX file."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"pskx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
