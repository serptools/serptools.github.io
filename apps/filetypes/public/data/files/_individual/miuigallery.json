{"slug":"miuigallery","extension":"miuigallery","name":"MIUI Gallery Junk Data","category":"miui-gallery-junk-data","summary":"","developer_org":"xiaomi","developer_name":"Xiaomi","more_information":{"description":["MIUI Gallery is the default photo and video gallery app installed on Xiaomi MIUI smartphones. In late 2020, users began noticing that MIUI Gallery was creating several MIUIGALLERY files, which took up a considerable amount of space on their devices' SD cards. These files contained junk data that MIUI Gallery did not need to operate.","To mitigate this issue, users can manually delete MIUIGALLERY files to reclaim space on their SD cards. (Doing so does not affect MIUI Gallery.) To resolve the issue completely, users can delete their MIUIGALLERY files and then install version 2.2.16.19 (or higher) of MIUI Gallery, which does not create MIUIGALLERY files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"miuigallery.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
