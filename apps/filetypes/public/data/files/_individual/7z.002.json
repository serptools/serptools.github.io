Typically, when you archive one or more files using 7-Zip, the program compresses those files into a single 7Z archive. However, you can use 7-Zip's Split to volumes, bytes: feature to instead split compressed files across multiple 7Z archives. Multi-volume archives are saved as a series of 7Z.### files.","The first file in a multi-volume archive always uses the .7z.001 extension. Additional files use extensions with incrementally higher numbers. For example, a multi-volume archive comprised of four files includes a .7z.001 , .7z.002 , .7z.003 , and .7z.004 file."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/7z_002_7368.png","alt":"7Z.002 file shown in 7-Zip","caption":"7Z.002 file shown in 7-Zip"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"7z.002.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
