This ransomware encrypts a user's files and appends them with the .poop extension. It then changes the user's desktop background to the image of a pile of poop, produces a ransom note named READ_IT.txt , and pops up a window containing ransom demands and instructions. (FileInfo recommends you never pay a ransom to decrypt your files.)","Ransomware is most commonly distributed within programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and installed an unverified program, that may be how your computer became infected by POOP ransomware."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"poop.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
