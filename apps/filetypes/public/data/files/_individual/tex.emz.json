{"slug":"tex.emz","extension":"tex.emz","name":"Street Fighter IV Texture File","category":"street-fighter-iv-texture-file","summary":"","developer_org":"dimps","developer_name":"Dimps","more_information":{"description":["Textures contained in the TEX.EMZ file may be used for different aspects of gameplay, such as the appearance of a stage or a character. You can tell what textures the TEX.EMZ file contains by looking at the name of the file and the location the file is stored.","For example, a TEX.EMZ file containing textures for a character bears the same name as the character ( [character].tex.emz ) and is located in a folder named after the character. A TEX.EMZ file storing textures for elements in a stage is named after the stage. For example, a TEX.EMZ file containing textures for the Volcanic Rim stage will be named STG_VCN.tex.emz and are saved in the \"stage\" folder in the game installation.","TEX.EMZ files are meant to be referenced by Street Fighter IV or Ultra Street Fighter IV, not manually opened. However, some gamers who enjoy modifying the appearance of stages in the game may want to open TEX.EMZ files. In this case, these gamers can use the SF4 Explorer in Windows to open the file.","NOTE: While Dimps introduced the TEX.EMZ file type for storing textures for their various games, the EMZ and DDS file types were introduced by Microsoft."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"tex.emz.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
