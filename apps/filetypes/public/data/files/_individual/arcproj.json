  "summary": "An ARCPROJ file is a project created by ARRIRAW Converter (ARC), an app used to view, process, and edit ARRIRAW images. It contains one or more images (paths to the image files, not the actual images) a user is editing in the app and effects a user has applied to the images, such as exposure, white balance, and tint. ARCPROJ files also store metadata about images imported in the project, including the camera device and lens that captured them.",
