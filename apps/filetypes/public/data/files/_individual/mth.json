It was available for DOS, Windows, and various Texas Instruments graphing calculators, such as the TI-89. Derive was discontinued in 2007.","Primarily, teachers and students used Derive to manipulate and process algebraic equations. These equations, including the functions and values they contained, could be saved as MTH files. This allowed Derive users to share the equations they'd created (or solved) with other users."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mth.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
