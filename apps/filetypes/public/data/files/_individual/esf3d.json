Using the Eos software, lighting designers can design, save, and run theater lighting sequences, referred to as shows.","Version 3 of Eos includes a feature named Augment3d, which allows lighting designers to create and program within a 3D representation of their theater lighting rig. When a designer saves a show file that contains Augment3d data, that show is saved as an ESF3D file. Optionally, if a designer wants to save their show without its Augmet3d data, they can instead save the show as an .ESF2 file."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"esf3d.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
