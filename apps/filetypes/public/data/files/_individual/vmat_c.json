When creating in-game objects, developers use VMAT files to apply textures and shading to those objects. When a game is compiled to be run by a user, VMAT files are transformed into VMAT_C files.","While most gamers will never encounter a VMAT_C file, those who want to mod Valve Source 2 games or create their own Source 2-powered games may interact with VMAT_C files. For example, those who want to mod Half-Life: Alyx or Dota 2 using Valve's official modding toolkits may encounter or create VMAT_C files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"vmat_c.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
