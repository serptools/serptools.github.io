However, Pokémon modders frequently extract GFPAK files from games and alter the resources they contain. For example, a modder might retrieve a GFPAK file from a game, extract the assets the GFPAK file contains, and alter those assets to make a Pokémon appear differently in-game.","After modifying the resources a GFPAK file contains, modders repackage the resources into a new GFPAK file. They can then install the file in the game from which it came, using custom Nintendo Switch firmware, and/or distribute the file for other players to install."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"gfpak.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
