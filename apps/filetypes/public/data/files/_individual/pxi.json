Additionally, PXI files are different from .PXD files, which are definition files that declare classes , functions , or variables for use in other Pyrex (or Cython) modules. While PXD files serve a similar purpose to .C header files, PXI files are more like inline text includes that are copied directly into a file at compile time.","NOTE: Pyrex is less commonly used today (not actively developed) but served as the basis for Cython, a more modern and widely adopted tool for writing Python-compatible C extensions."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/pxi_13840.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .pxi file in Furnace Creek Software Pixen 5","caption":"PXI file open in Furnace Creek Software Pixen 5"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"pxi.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
