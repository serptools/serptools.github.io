If a user's modified configuration file and the upgraded package's configuration file differ, pacman will not replace the user's modified configuration file. Instead, it will save the new configuration file as a PACNEW file.","Pacman notifies users when it creates a PACNEW file. (This notification includes the location at which the PACNEW file was saved.) If pacman creates a PACNEW file during a package upgrade process, you must manually resolve the differences between your current configuration file and the PACNEW file."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"pacnew.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
