And in each row, every cell value is separated by a column delimiter (commas). Default row and column delimiters can be overridden by the user if other characters are preferred. Here is an example of how data is stored, by default, in a DEL file:","\"Johnson, Brad\",50.50,200 \"Davis, Joe\",60.50,280 \"Barnes,Isaak\",48.75,193","Since DEL files are stored in plain text, you can open them with any text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad or Apple TextEdit. You can also open the files with spreadsheet programs, such as Microsoft Excel and Apache Calc (included with OpenOffice)."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"del.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
