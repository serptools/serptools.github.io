When you create and save a drawing with openCanvas 6 by selecting File → New... , then selecting File → Save or Save As... , the application creates an OE6 file to store the events you performed to create the drawing. After saving the OE6 file, you can close the drawing, re-open it, which replays the recorded events, and then you can continue editing it.","Previous versions of openCanvas saved event files as .WPE , .OC3 , .OC4 , and .OC5 files. The number represents the version of the software. However, when Portalgraphics released openCanvas 7, it replaced OC6 files with the .OCI file type."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/oe6_12394.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .oe6 file in Portalgraphics openCanvas 7","caption":"OE6 file open in Portalgraphics openCanvas 7"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"oe6.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
