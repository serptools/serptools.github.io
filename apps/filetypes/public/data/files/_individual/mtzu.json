This ransomware encrypts a user's files and renames them to use the .mtzu extension.","MTZU ransomware is one of many variants of STOP DJVU ransomware. Just like other STOP DJVU variants, MTZU ransomware produces a plain text ransom note, named _readme.txt , in every folder that contains an infected file. This ransom note contains instructions users can supposedly follow to restore their files.","MTZU ransomware is most commonly distributed within programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles.
