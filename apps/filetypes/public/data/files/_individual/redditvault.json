It stores a record of a user's Community Points, Collectible Avatars, and other blockchain-based Reddit assets.","When a user creates their Reddit Vault wallet, the app generates a 12 word Recovery Phrase unique to that wallet. If a user loses access to their wallet, they can use their Recovery Phrase to regain access to it. For example, if a user is forced to uninstall and reinstall the Reddit app, they can use their Recovery Phrase to regain access to their wallet.","During the wallet creation process, Reddit Vault prompts users to both write down their Recovery Phrase and create a cloud backup of the phrase (typically stored in Google Drive or iCloud). Recovery Phrase backups are stored as encrypted plain text, saved within REDDITVAULT files."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/redditvault_13420.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .redditvault file in Apple TextEdit","caption":"REDDITVAULT file open in Apple TextEdit"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"redditvault.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
