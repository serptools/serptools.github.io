When transferring the recorded content with the MFS_FTP server program included with the TiVo device, the program combines the various chunks of data into one large binary TY+ file.","If the TiVo recording does not include metadata describing the TV show or movie, the MFS_FTP program saves the video as a .TY TiVo recording file. The TY+ format is the same as the format used in TY files, except it stores metadata at the end of the file, which is what the \"+\" refers to in the .ty+ file extension.","NOTE: TiVo recordings are also saved as .TIVO files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ty+.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
