Models include BOXY, Ultra Vision 4K, and Magic 4K Plus.","Typically, the Dune HD media players organize AAI images into folders based on the content for which they are designed. For example, information for an Internet radio station may be saved in the \"Station1\" folder, which includes a .TXT file describing the visualization parameters and the AAI image for the station's icon (likely named icon.aai ).","The AAImageGen app available from Dune HD allows you to convert images, such as .JPG , .PNG , and .BMP , to the AAI format. The tool can run on Windows.","NOTE: The maximum AAI image size is 2047 x 2047 pixels."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/aai_13696.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .aai file in AAImageViewer 1","caption":"AAI file open in AAImageViewer 1"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"aai.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
