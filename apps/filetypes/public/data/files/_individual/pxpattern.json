For example, a pixel artist may create a repeating cobblestone pattern in Pixen and save it as a PXPATTERN file to quickly fill large areas of a game map. The artist then reuses the pattern across multiple scenes to keep the design consistent and speed up their workflow.","NOTE: To create a PXPATTERN file with the Pro version of Pixen, select Patterns , right-click the pattern, and select Export . The free version cannot export PXPATTERN files."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/pxpattern_13843.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .pxpattern file in Furnace Creek Software Pixen 5","caption":"PXPATTERN file open in Furnace Creek Software Pixen 5"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"pxpattern.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
