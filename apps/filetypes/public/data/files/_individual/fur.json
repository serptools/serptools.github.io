Notably, the songs users create with Furnace can be played on over 50 sound chips, all of which Furnace can emulate as users create songs. (Furnace can even emulate multiple chips at the same time.)","By default, the songs users create in Furnace are saved as FUR files. These files define the song's channels and included notes, as well as the instruments and audio effects applied to those notes. After finalizing a song in Furnace, users can export that song in several other formats, to play it with an audio player or sound chip (as well as open it in other chiptune trackers)."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/fur_13313.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .fur file in Furnace","caption":"FUR file open in Furnace"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"fur.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
