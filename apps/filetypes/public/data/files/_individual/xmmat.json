The XMMAT templates are especially helpful when creating a mind map, so you do not have to start from scratch.","While most MindManager users save templates as binary MMAT files, the XMMAT format is more transportable since it utilizes the widely-supported XML standard. However, XMMAT files are typically larger than their MMAT counterparts.","NOTE: Corel Corporation acquired MindManager from Mindjet in 2016."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/xmmat_12593.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .xmmat file in Corel MindManager 22","caption":"XMMAT file open in Corel MindManager 22"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"xmmat.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
