Transmit keeps a record of all the servers a user is logged in to, as well as the user's server login credentials. The user's servers appear in Transmit's Servers menu.","If a user wants to transfer their server list and login credentials to another instance of Transmit, they can do so by exporting that information as a TRANSMITSERVERS file. Then, when the user opens their new instance of Transmit, they can import the file to connect to their servers.","NOTE: Panic began using the TRANSMITSERVERS file type in version 5. Previous versions of Transit stored exported server lists in .EXPORTEDFAVORITES or EXPORTEDSERVERS files."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"transmitservers.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
