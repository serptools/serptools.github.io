It allows users to download or import OSM maps, mark them up with tagged nods and paths, and submit their edits to the official OpenStreetMap project.","Users often save their in-progress JOSM editing sessions as JOZ files, so they can continue editing those sessions later. JOZ files are .ZIP archives that contain the OSM layers a user has imported into their session and a JOS file.","The JOS file is an .XML file that describes the session's layers (including OSM layers and image layers), viewport settings at the time of being saved, and version. When a JOSM user opens a JOZ file, the program loads the session's settings from its JOS file and uses those settings to display the session (and its corresponding OSM files) correctly."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"session.jos","description":"session.jos - The default name that JOSM assigns to JOS files."}],"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/jos_13557.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .jos file in Microsoft Visual Studio Code","caption":"JOS file open in Microsoft Visual Studio Code"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"jos.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
