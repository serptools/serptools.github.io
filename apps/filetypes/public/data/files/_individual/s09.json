For example, if your example.mp4 file is too large to send via email, you can Zip compress and split or just split the file into smaller file sizes. If you choose to split it into 3 equal parts, the MP4 file becomes example.mp4.s00 , example.mp4.s01 , example.mp4.s02.exe . ZipSplitter appends the last part with the .exe extension, which, when double-clicked, combines the split parts of the MP4 file and restores the file."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"s09.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
