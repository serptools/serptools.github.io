When a developer uploads their app's .AAB file to the Google Play Store, their app's baseline profile is uploaded as part of that package.","When an Android user downloads the app from the Google Play Store, they receive both the app's .APK file and its baseline profile, saved as a PROFM or .PROF file. During app installation, the Android Runtime performs ahead-of-time compilation on the code include in the app's baseline profile. This allows the app to perform the functions included in its baseline profile more quickly, because those functions do not have to be just-in-time compiled."]},"common_filenames":[{"filename":"Baseline.profm","description":"Baseline.profm - The default name assigned to baseline profiles."}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"profm.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
