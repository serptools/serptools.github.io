As data volumes increase in the genetic software field, the CRAM format was designed to reduce the disk foot print of alignment data.","Short read alignment is the process of deciphering where a sequence comes from in the genome. This can be difficult since the reference genome is rather large and you aren't always looking for exact matches in the reference genome. Short read aligners are used to search enormous sequences for matches and near-matches. Since the sequences are so large, compression provided by formats like CRAM is necessary for keeping file sizes manageable."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"cram.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
