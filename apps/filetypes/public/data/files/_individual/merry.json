Merry X-Mas infects a user's computer, encrypts and renames the user's files, and then produces a ransom note named YOUR_FILES_ARE_DEAD.HTA or MERRY_I_LOVE_YOU_BRUCE.HTA . The ransomware then automatically opens the ransom note, which contains a threatening countdown.","Merry X-mas ransomware is distributed via spam emails that claim to be a consumer complaint notification from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). When you click the link the email contains, it downloads a file named COMPLAINT.pdf to your computer. This file is actually an .EXE file, not a .PDF file. Opening the file executes the program it contains, which installs Merry X-mas ransomware on your computer.","FileInfo recommends you never pay a ransom to decrypt your files. Also, free decryption tools exist that may allow you to restore your MERRY files to their normal state.","NOTE: Variants of Merry X-mas ransomware append users' files with the .mrcr1 , .rare1 , .rmcm1 , or .pegs1 extension, instead of .merry ."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"merry.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
