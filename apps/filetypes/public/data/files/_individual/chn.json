It was among the early tools designed to assist researchers in the social sciences, including anthropology, sociology, education, and psychology, to code and analyze text-based qualitative data, such as interview transcripts, field notes, and open-ended survey responses.","NOTE: Beginning with version 6 of Ethnograph, the program no longer saves information in a standalone CHN file.
