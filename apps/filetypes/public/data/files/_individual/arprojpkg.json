For example, a Spark AR Studio user could create a \"bubbles\" effect and then apply the effect to add AR bubbles to a video.","When a user saves a Spark AR Studio project, the program creates a new project directory. This directory contains an ARPROJ file and any assets the user has imported into their project. If a user wants to share their Spark AR Studio project with another user, they can do so by packaging all these files as a single ARPROJPKG file.","Packaging a project zips its ARPROJ and asset files into one compressed file that can be shared over the Internet more easily. Sharing a project as a package also prevents users from accidentally not providing the project's assets. To package a project as an ARPROJPKG file, users select File â†’ Package... from AR Studio's menu."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"arprojpkg.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
