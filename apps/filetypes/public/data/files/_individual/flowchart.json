However, you may receive the FLOWCHART file as an email attachment from a PureFlow user. You need to download and install PureFlow on an iPad in order to open and view the FLOWCHART file.","The app allows you to create a diagram by adding text in shapes that can be connected. You can choose the color of the shapes and the font and size of the text. When you choose to save the flowchart, PureFlow creates the FLOWCHART file to save the contents. You can share your FLOWCHART via email or iCloud."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/flowchart_10460.jpg","alt":"Screenshot of a .flowchart file in PureFlow 1","caption":"FLOWCHART file open in PureFlow 1"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"flowchart.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
