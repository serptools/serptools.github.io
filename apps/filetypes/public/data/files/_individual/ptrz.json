PTRZ ransomware is a variant of STOP Djvu ransomware, a popular type of ransomware distributed by cybercriminals.","Like other variants of STOP Djvu, PTRZ ransomware encrypts many of a user's files, renames those files to use the .ptrz extension, and then creates a ransom note named _readme.txt . This ransom note contains instructions that users can supposedly follow to pay a ransom and decrypt their files.","PTRZ ransomware is most commonly distributed within programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and installed an unverified program, that may be how your computer became infected by PTRZ ransomware."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"ptrz.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
