It enabled researchers and scientists to simulate molecular interactions and conduct structure-activity relationship studies, helping accelerate product development in several fields, including pharmaceuticals and materials science. As users performed various chemical analysis tasks with UniChem, the software saved their results in NVL files, which users could then review."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"nvl.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
