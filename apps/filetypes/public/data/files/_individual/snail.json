With Snail IDE, you can create simple programs, including games and animations, by dragging, dropping, and connecting code blocks. When developing your game, you can save your progress as a SNAIL project file. Snail IDE saves SNAIL files in a format similar to the .PMP files PenguinMod creates."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/snail_13674.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .snail file in Snail IDE","caption":"SNAIL file open in Snail IDE"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"snail.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
