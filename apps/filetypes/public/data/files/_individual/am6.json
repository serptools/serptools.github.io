As users work on their project with version 6 of AutoPlay Media Studio, they save it as an AM6 file, which they can then close and reopen to make further modifications. Once completed, users can build the project into a standalone executable ( .EXE ) file or Disk Image ( .ISO ) file for distribution.","Different versions of AutoPlay Media Studio save projects with different file extensions. For example, version 4 saves projects as .AM4 files and version 5 saves projects as .AM5 files.
