The MDK includes many tools, including the µVision IDE.","µVision allows developers to write microcontroller programs in C/C++ and assembly. They can then build, test, and debug their programs. Program development projects created in µVision are saved as UVPROJX files. These files contain XML-formatted data that tells µVision where the project's source code files and other files are saved, so it can load them correctly."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"uvprojx.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
