Typically, when you archive one or more files using 7-Zip, the program packages those files in a single 7Z archive. However, you can instead choose to package files in a multi-volume, or split, archive. Splitting files into a multi-volume archive can make them easier to store, upload, and download, since each volume's file size is smaller than a single-volume archive's would be. (For example, you can split what would be a single 80 MB 7Z file into eight 10 MB 7Z.### files.)","7-Zip saves multi-volume archives as a series of 7Z.### files. The first file in this series always uses the .7z.001 extension. The number of additional files included in a multi-volume archive varies, depending on the size of the files being archived and the volume size you've selected using the Split to volumes, bytes: feature."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/7z_001_7367.png","alt":"7Z.001 file shown in 7-Zip","caption":"7Z.001 file shown in 7-Zip"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"7z.001.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
