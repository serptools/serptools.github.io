The virus is a trojan horse that was introduced through a personal document (most likely a fake invoice .DOC or DOCX file asking you to enable macros) attached to an email. Once the virus affects your computer it begins scrambling your files, renaming them, and encrypting them. The virus usually then generates a .TXT ransom note informing you of the encryption of your files and what you need to do to recover them."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"bc5b.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
