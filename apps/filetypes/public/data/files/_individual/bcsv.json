BCSV files are CSV files that have been converted to a binary format so they can be included in Nintendo video games.","For example, Animal Crossing: New Horizons contains BCSV files that, among other things, control how often animals appear. While many games use BCSV files, all BCSV files are not formatted the same. Thus, a utility that can open one game's BCSV files may not be able to open other games'."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"bcsv.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
