Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze stores its in-game dialog in MSTBIN files, which are the same as MSBT files, except they use Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze's package and chunk descriptor. Each region's dialog is stored in its own chunk, denoted by a region-specific descriptor at the chunk's start.","Just like MSBT files, MSTBIN files specify when each piece of dialog appears, who (or what) says the dialog, and the dialog's text. They also specify in what language the dialog is written. Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze contains many MSTBIN files, used in different sections of the game."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"mstbin.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
