Unlike many smart contract languages, Clarity is decidable, meaning users can analyze contract outcomes before execution. Clarity is also interpreted rather than compiled , which helps reduce security risks.","Additionally, Clarity enforces transparent and predictable execution by disallowing reentrancy and hidden control flows.
