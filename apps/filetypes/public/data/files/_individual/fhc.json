{"slug":"fhc","extension":"fhc","name":"FHC Data File","category":"fhc-data-file","summary":"","developer_org":"calico-pie","developer_name":"Calico Pie","more_information":{"description":["Family Historian allows you to enter information about your family tree and turn that information into a diagram. You can create many types of diagrams, including Ancestor, Descendant, Hourglass, and All Relative diagrams, that show different views of how your family members are related to one another. These diagrams are saved as FHC, or Family Historian Chart, files. They are typically saved in a Family Historian project's Charts directory.","Each FHC file contains references used to build a diagram from a related GED file. The FHC file itself does not contain any family history data. If you attempt to open an FHC file without its associated GED file, it will not appear correctly in Family Historian. (Therefore, if you plan to share an FHC file with another Family Historian user, it's likely easiest to share your entire Family Historian project.)","NOTE: Family Historian also allows you to print the chart an FHC file describes."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"fhc.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
