It allows users to browse, open, copy, delete, and share their files.","In some cases, when a user moves, copies, or deletes a file with Mi File Explorer, the program creates and does not delete an FE_TMP file. This issue can cause Mi File Explorer and the MIUI operating system to believe the user's SD card has become corrupted.","To resolve this issue, use a different file manager or a file recovery program (such as TeamWin Recovery Project) to delete any FE_TMP files stored on your SD card. (Often, Mi File Explorer places FE_TMP files in SD cards' root directory.) To avoid this issue recurring, you may want to use a different file manager to move, copy, delete, or share files in the future.","NOTE: If you use Mi File Explorer to move a file to another storage device (such as a USB flash drive), Mi File Explorer may also create an FE_TMP file on that device."]},"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"fe_tmp.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
