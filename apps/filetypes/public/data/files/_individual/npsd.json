It allows users to create and save layer-based images as NPSD files, also known as NPS Image Editor Documents.","Layer-based editing allows users to add and edit different image elements without interfering with other elements. For example, an NPS Image Editor user could add a text element on one image layer, add a shape element on a different image layer, and edit both entirely separately, without modifying the other.","After a user has finished editing the image their NPSD file contains, they can use NPS Image Editor to export the image as a .JPG , .GIF , .PNG , .TIF , or .BMP image, for use in other image viewing and editing programs. Doing so will \"flatten\" the image, compressing all its layers into a single layer."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/npsd_12417.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .npsd file in NPS Image Editor","caption":"NPSD file open in NPS Image Editor"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"npsd.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
