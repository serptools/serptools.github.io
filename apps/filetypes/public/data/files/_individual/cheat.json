Using navi saves users the trouble of remembering and correctly typing commands. Instead, the user can enter navi in their terminal, browse the list of commands navi contains, and press Enter to execute the command they need.","Navi retrieves commands from cheatsheets, which are plain text files saved with the .cheat extension. Typically, a CHEAT file contains a set of related commands, as well as descriptions of what those commands do. Each CHEAT file starts with the % character and one or more tags used to categorize the commands the file contains. Each individual command's description begins with the # character.","While the majority of CHEAT files are available from navi's GitHub page (linked below), other GitHub repositories contain additional CHEAT files. You can import these CHEAT files into navi using the instructions in the Cheatsheet repositories section of navi's documentation."]},"images":[{"url":"https://fileinfo.com/img/ss/sm/cheat_12278.png","alt":"Screenshot of a .cheat file in GitHub Atom","caption":"CHEAT file open in GitHub Atom"}],"updated_at":"2025-08-09","sources":[{"url":"cheat.html","retrieved_at":"2025-08-09"}]}
